Today, there are about 1 000 different pesticides in use composed of more than 800 active ingredients and the number is still increasing. Historically, the use of pesticides has allowed great advances in agriculture and also in the public health sector as vector control for diseases such as malaria. However, the excessive and inappropriate use of pesticides, and the mismanagement of obsolete and highly harmful pesticide stocks, can cause unintended damage to non-target species (FAO and ITPS, 2017). There is considerable societal concern about the use of pesticides. The greatest problem is that stores of obsolete pesticides still occur in many countries. Spills and leakage from these depots continue to cause significant soil pollution. Accidental spills and leakage of non-restricted pesticides as well as improper disposal of storage containers can lead to unsafe levels of pesticides in soils; this is a widespread point source of soil pollution.

Low concentrations of contaminants in the soil often lead to adaptive strategies through changes in physiology and feeding behaviours. Changes in the activity of soil organisms can also occur, resulting in the alteration of biogeochemical cycles. Additionally, polluted soils in turn become a source of pollution for groundwater, through leaching of contaminants, and for fresh water and the marine environment, since contaminants can be transported off-site through wind and water erosion. All those changes can be gradual or remain inert until an inflexion point is reached and a severe degradation occurs.

Africa\u2019s urban population increased by 2 000 percent between 1950 and 2015. In contrast to developed countries and several developing countries, the rapid urbanization in sub-Saharan Africa has resulted in the absence of the conventional land-use zoning approach, and people have settled in areas directly next to industrial areas, mines or agricultural processing facilities to be in close proximity to areas with employment opportunities. This poses significant threats to human health in areas with polluted soils. A particular risk factor in sub-Saharan Africa is the practice of geophagy (deliberate ingestion of soil).

The informal recycling of used lead-acid batteries is a significant source of lead in soil. At a typical informal recycler, the plastic box that holds the battery components is broken open with a hand axe or machete and the sulphuric acid solution inside is dumped on the ground or into a storm drain. The lead plates are removed and placed in a hole in the ground, which is then is filled with charcoal and ignited. The molten lead is then ladled into ingot moulds, cooled, and sold back to battery manufacturers. The process is typically conducted with no pollution control equipment or regulatory oversight.

Chemicals such as hazardous pesticides, persistent organic pollutants and products containing trace elements such as lead and mercury are still used in the region, to the detriment of both environmental and human health.

Neurotoxicity. Any adverse effect on the structure and/or the normal activity of the nervous system after exposure to contaminants (neurotoxins) (Spencer and Lein, 2014). Point-source soil pollution. Point-source soil pollution occurs in a limited area, and in most cases the source and identity of the pollution is readily identified. The cause of the point-source pollution can be accidental (for example, through spills of contaminants or leakage from storage containers) or it may occur as a by-product of an intentional activity (e.g. former factory sites, landfills, lead battery or electronic waste recycling sites, and mine tailings). Ideally, appropriate governance regulates and prevents soil pollution. However, many examples of lack of regulation, or weak implementation of existing regulations, for soil pollution are included in this report. Soil contamination. Soil contamination occurs when the concentration of a chemical or substance is higher than would occur naturally, but is not at a level known to cause harm to non-target organisms. Soil pollution. Soil pollution refers to the presence of a chemical or substance that is out of place and/or is present at a higher than natural background concentration, and that has an adverse effect on any non-target organism. The specification of non-target organisms in these definitions recognizes that some chemicals and substances are added to plants and soils specifically to suppress target organisms such as pesticides. 58", "embedding_index": 152, "page_number": 80}], "metadata": {"source": "new_data_folder", "filename": "UN_2021_GlobalAssessmentofSoilPollution.pdf", "file_type": ".pdf"}}
