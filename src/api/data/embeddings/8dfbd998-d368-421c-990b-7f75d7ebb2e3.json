Bloomberg Mr. Mark Carney Chairman Financial Stability Board Bank for International Settlements Centralbahnplatz 2 CH-4002 Basel Switzerland Dear Chairman Carney, On behalf of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures, I am pleased to present this final report setting out our recommendations for helping businesses disclose climate-related financial information. As you know, warming of the planet caused by greenhouse gas emissions poses serious risks to the global economy and will have an impact across many economic sectors. It is difficult for investors to know which companies are most at risk from climate change, which are best prepared, and which are taking action. The Task Force’s report establishes recommendations for disclosing clear, comparable and consistent information about the risks and opportunities presented by climate change. Their widespread adoption will ensure that the effects of climate change become routinely considered in business and investment decisions. Adoption of these recommendations will also help companies better demonstrate responsibility and foresight in their consideration of climate issues. That will lead to smarter, more efficient allocation of capital, and help smooth the transition to a more sustainable, low-carbon economy. The industry Task Force spent 18 months consulting with a wide range of business and financial leaders to hone its recommendations and consider how to help companies better communicate key climate-related information. The feedback we received in response to the Task Force’s draft report confirmed broad support from industry and others, and involved productive dialogue among companies and banks, insurers, and investors. This was and remains a collaborative process, and as these recommendations are implemented, we hope that this dialogue and feedback continues. Since the Task Force began its work, we have also seen a significant increase in demand from investors for improved climate-related financial disclosures. This comes amid unprecedented support among companies for action to tackle climate change. I want to thank the Financial Stability Board for its leadership in promoting better disclosure of climate-related financial risks, and for its support of the Task Force’s work. I am also grateful to the Task Force members and Secretariat for their extensive contributions and dedication to this effort. The risk climate change poses to businesses and financial markets is real and already present. It is more important than ever that businesses lead in understanding and responding to these risks—and seizing the opportunities—to build a stronger, more resilient, and sustainable global economy. Sincerely, Michael R. Bloombergr from Michael R. Bloomberg Recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures i",

      "text": "Executive Summary Financial Markets and Transparency One of the essential functions of financial markets is to price risk to support informed, efficient capital-allocation decisions. Accurate and timely disclosure of current and past operating and financial results is fundamental to this function, but it is increasingly important to understand the governance and risk management context in which financial results are achieved. The financial crisis of 2007-2008 was an important reminder of the repercussions that weak corporate governance and risk management practices can have on asset values. This has resulted in increased demand for transparency from organizations on their governance structures, strategies, and risk management practices. Without the right information, investors and others may incorrectly price or value assets, leading to a misallocation of capital. Increasing transparency makes markets more efficient and economies more stable and resilient. —Michael R. Bloomberg Financial Implications of Climate Change One of the most significant, and perhaps most misunderstood, risks that organizations face today relates to climate change. While it is widely recognized that continued emission of greenhouse gases will cause further warming of the planet and this warming could lead to damaging economic and social consequences, the exact timing and severity of physical effects are difficult to estimate. The large-scale and long-term nature of the problem makes it uniquely challenging, especially in the context of economic decision making. Accordingly, many organizations incorrectly perceive the implications of climate change to be long term and, therefore, not necessarily relevant to decisions made today. The potential impacts of climate change on organizations, however, are not only physical and do not manifest only in the long term. To stem the disastrous effects of climate change within this century, nearly 200 countries agreed in December 2015 to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and accelerate the transition to a lower-carbon economy. The reduction in greenhouse gas emissions implies movement away from fossil fuel energy and related physical assets. This coupled with rapidly declining costs and increased deployment of clean and energy-efficient technologies could have significant, near-term financial implications for organizations dependent on extracting, producing, and using coal, oil, and natural gas. While such organizations may face significant climate-related risks, they are not alone. In fact, climate-related risks and the expected transition to a lower-carbon economy affect most economic sectors and industries. While changes associated with a transition to a lower-carbon economy present significant risk, they also create significant opportunities for organizations focused on climate change mitigation and adaptation solutions. For many investors, climate change poses significant financial challenges and opportunities, now and in the future. The expected transition to a lower-carbon economy is estimated to require around $1 trillion of investments",

The expected transition to a lower-carbon economy is estimated to require around $1 trillion of investments a year for the foreseeable future, generating new investment opportunities.1 At the same time, the risk-return profile of organizations exposed to climate- related risks may change significantly as such organizations may be more affected by physical impacts of climate change, climate policy, and new technologies. In fact, a 2015 study estimated the value at risk, as a result of climate change, to the total global stock of manageable assets as 1 International Energy Agency, World Energy Outlook Special Briefing for COP21, 2015.

      "text": "ranging from $4.2 trillion to $43 trillion between now and the end of the century.2 The study highlights that “much of the impact on future assets will come through weaker growth and lower asset returns across the board.” This suggests investors may not be able to avoid climate-related risks by moving out of certain asset classes as a wide range of asset types could be affected. Both investors and the organizations in which they invest, therefore, should consider their longer-term strategies and most efficient allocation of capital. Organizations that invest in activities that may not be viable in the longer term may be less resilient to the transition to a lower-carbon economy; and their investors will likely experience lower returns. Compounding the effect on longer-term returns is the risk that present valuations do not adequately factor in climate-related risks because of insufficient information. As such, long-term investors need adequate information on how organizations are preparing for a lower-carbon economy. Furthermore, because the transition to a lower-carbon economy requires significant and, in some cases, disruptive changes across economic sectors and industries in the near term, financial policymakers are interested in the implications for the global financial system, especially in terms of avoiding financial dislocations and sudden losses in asset values. Given such concerns and the potential impact on financial intermediaries and investors, the G20 Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors asked the Financial Stability Board to review how the financial sector can take account of climate-related issues. As part of its review, the Financial Stability Board identified the need for better information to support informed investment, lending, and insurance underwriting decisions and improve understanding and analysis of climate-related risks and opportunities. Better information will also help investors engage with companies on the resilience of their strategies and capital spending, which should help promote a smooth rather than an abrupt transition to a lower-carbon economy. Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures To help identify the information needed by investors, lenders, and insurance underwriters to appropriately assess and price climate-related risks and opportunities, the Financial Stability Board established an industry-led task force: the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (Task Force). The Task Force was asked to develop voluntary, consistent climate- related financial disclosures that would be useful to investors, lenders, and insurance underwriters in understanding material risks. The 32-member Task Force is global; its members were selected by the Financial Stability Board and come from various organizations, including large banks, insurance companies, asset managers, pension funds, large non-financial companies, accounting and consulting firms, and credit rating agencies.

In developing and finalizing its recommendations, the Task Force solicited input throughout the process.3 First, in April 2016, the Task Force sought public comment on the scope and high-level objectives of its work. As the Task Force developed its disclosure recommendations, it continued to solicit feedback through hundreds of industry interviews, meetings, and other touchpoints. Then, in December 2016, the Task Force issued its draft recommendations and sought public comment on the recommendations as well as certain key issues, receiving over 300 responses. This final report reflects the Task Force’s consideration of industry and other public feedback received throughout 2016 and 2017. Section E contains a summary of key issues raised by the industry as well as substantive changes to the report since December. Disclosure in Mainstream Financial Filings The Task Force recommends that preparers of climate-related financial disclosures provide such disclosures in their mainstream (i.e., public) annual financial filings. In most G20 jurisdictions, companies with public debt or equity have a legal obligation to disclose material information in their financial filings—including material climate-related information. The Task Force believes climate-related issues are or could be material for many organizations, and its recommendations should be useful to organizations in complying more effectively with existing disclosure obligations.4 In addition, disclosure in mainstream financial filings should foster shareholder engagement and broader use of climate-related financial disclosures, thus promoting a more informed understanding of climate-related risks and opportunities by investors and others. The Task Force also believes that publication of climate-related financial information in mainstream annual financial filings will help ensure that appropriate controls govern the production and disclosure of the required information. More specifically, the Task Force expects the governance processes for these disclosures would be similar to those used for existing public financial disclosures and would likely involve review by the chief financial officer and audit committee, as appropriate. Importantly, organizations should make financial disclosures in accordance with their national disclosure requirements. If certain elements of the recommendations are incompatible with national disclosure requirements for financial filings, the Task Force encourages organizations to disclose those elements in other official company reports that are issued at least annually, widely distributed and available to investors and others, and subject to internal governance processes that are the same or substantially similar to those used for financial reporting. Core Elements of Climate-Related Financial Disclosures The Task Force structured its recommendations around four thematic areas that represent core elements of how organizations operate: governance, strategy, risk management, and metrics and targets (Figure 2, p",

Core Elements of Climate-Related Financial Disclosures The Task Force structured its recommendations around four thematic areas that represent core elements of how organizations operate: governance, strategy, risk management, and metrics and targets (Figure 2, p. v). The four overarching recommendations are supported by recommended disclosures that build out the framework with information that will help investors and others understand how reporting organizations assess climate-related risks and opportunities.5 In addition, there is guidance to support all organizations in developing climate-related financial disclosures consistent with the recommendations and recommended disclosures. The guidance assists preparers by providing context and suggestions for implementing the recommended disclosures. For the financial sector and certain non-financial sectors, supplemental guidance was developed to highlight important sector-specific considerations and provide a fuller picture of potential climate-related financial impacts in those sectors. 3 See Appendix 2: Task Force Objectives and Approach for more information. 4 The Task Force encourages organizations where climate-related issues could be material in the future to begin disclosing climate-related financial information outside financial filings to facilitate the incorporation of such information into financial filings once climate-related issues are determined to be material. 5 See Figure 4 on p. 14 for the Task Force's recommendations and recommended disclosures.

The Task Force recognizes the use of scenarios in assessing climate-related issues and their potential financial implications is relatively recent and practices will evolve over time, but believes such analysis is important for improving the disclosure of decision-useful, climate-related financial information. Conclusion Recognizing that climate-related financial reporting is still evolving, the Task Force’s recommendations provide a foundation to improve investors’ and others’ ability to appropriately assess and price climate-related risk and opportunities. The Task Force’s recommendations aim to be ambitious, but also practical for near-term adoption. The Task Force expects to advance the quality of mainstream financial disclosures related to the potential effects of climate change on organizations today and in the future and to increase investor engagement with boards and senior management on climate-related issues. Improving the quality of climate-related financial disclosures begins with organizations’ willingness to adopt the Task Force’s recommendations. Organizations already reporting climate- related information under other frameworks may be able to disclose under this framework immediately and are strongly encouraged to do so. Those organizations in early stages of evaluating the impact of climate change on their businesses and strategies can begin by disclosing climate-related issues as they relate to governance, strategy, and risk management practices. The Task Force recognizes the challenges associated with measuring the impact of climate change, but believes that by moving climate-related issues into mainstream annual financial filings, practices and techniques will evolve more rapidly. Improved practices and techniques, including data analytics, should further improve the quality of climate-related financial disclosures and, ultimately, support more appropriate pricing of risks and allocation of capital in the global economy. 6 A 2° Celsius (2°C) scenario lays out an energy system deployment pathway and an emissions trajectory consistent with limiting the global average temperature increase to 2",

      "text": "A Introduction 1. Background It is widely recognized that continued emission of greenhouse gases will cause further warming of the Earth and that warming above 2° Celsius (2°C), relative to the pre-industrial period, could lead to catastrophic economic and social consequences.7 As evidence of the growing recognition of the risks posed by climate change, in December 2015, nearly 200 governments agreed to strengthen the global response to the threat of climate change by “holding the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2°C above pre-industrial levels and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels,” referred to as the Paris Agreement.8 The large-scale and long-term nature of the problem makes it uniquely challenging, especially in the context of economic decision making. Moreover, the current understanding of the potential financial risks posed by climate change—to companies, investors, and the financial system as a whole—is still at an early stage. There is a growing demand for decision-useful, climate-related information by a range of A participants in the financial markets.9 Creditors and investors are increasingly demanding access Introduction to risk information that is consistent, comparable, reliable, and clear. There has also been increased focus, especially since the financial crisis of 2007-2008, on the negative impact that B weak corporate governance can have on shareholder value, resulting in increased demand for Climate-Related Risks, Opportunities, and transparency from organizations on their risks and risk management practices, including those Financial Impacts related to climate change. C The growing demand for decision-useful, climate-related information has resulted in the Recommendations and Guidance development of several climate-related disclosure standards. Many of the existing standards, however, focus on disclosure of climate-related information, such as greenhouse gas (GHG) D emissions and other sustainability metrics. Users of such climate-related disclosures commonly Scenario Analysis and cite the lack of information on the financial implications around the climate-related aspects of an Climate-Related Issues organization's business as a key gap. Users also cite inconsistencies in disclosure practices, a lack E of context for information, use of boilerplate, and non-comparable reporting as major obstacles Key Issues Considered and to incorporating climate-related risks and opportunities (collectively referred to as climate-related Areas for Further Work issues) as considerations in their investment, lending, and insurance underwriting decisions over F the medium and long term.10 In addition, evidence suggests that the lack of consistent Conclusion information hinders investors and others from considering climate-related issues in their asset",

      "text": "areas for possible further work, and the possible roles the FSB and others could play in taking that work forward. The discussions continually returned to a common theme: the need for better information.”14 In most G20 jurisdictions, companies with public debt or equity have a legal obligation to disclose material risks in their financial reports—including material climate-related risks. However, the absence of a standardized framework for disclosing climate-related financial risks makes it difficult for organizations to determine what information should be included in their filings and how it should be presented. Even when reporting similar climate-related information, disclosures are often difficult to compare due to variances in mandatory and voluntary frameworks. The resulting fragmentation in reporting practices and lack of focus on financial impacts have prevented investors, lenders, insurance underwriters, and other users of disclosures from accessing complete information that can inform their economic decisions. Furthermore, because financial-sector organizations’ disclosures depend, in part, on those from the companies in which they invest or lend, regulators face challenges in using financial-sector organizations’ existing disclosures to determine system-wide exposures to climate-related risks. In response, the FSB established the industry-led Task Force on Climate-related Financial A Disclosures (TCFD or Task Force) in December 2015 to design a set of recommendations for Introduction consistent “disclosures that will help financial market participants understand their climate- B related risks.”15 See Box 1 (p. 3) for more information on the Task Force. Climate-Related Risks, Opportunities, and Financial Impacts 2. The Task Force’s Remit C The FSB called on the Task Force to develop climate-related disclosures that “could promote more Recommendations and informed investment, credit [or lending], and insurance underwriting decisions” and, in turn, Guidance “would enable stakeholders to understand better the concentrations of carbon-related assets in D the financial sector and the financial system’s exposures to climate-related risks.”16,17 The FSB Scenario Analysis and noted that disclosures by the financial sector in particular would “foster an early assessment of Climate-Related Issues these risks” and “facilitate market discipline.” Such disclosures would also “provide a source of E data that can be analyzed at a systemic level, to facilitate authorities’ assessments of the Key Issues Considered and materiality of any risks posed by climate change to the financial sector, and the channels through Areas for Further Work which this is most likely to be transmitted.”18 F The FSB also emphasized that “any disclosure recommendations by the Task Force would be Conclusion voluntary, would need to incorporate the principle",

The FSB further stated that the Task Force’s climate-related financial disclosure recommendations should not “add to the already well developed body of existing disclosure schemes.”20 In response, the Task Force drew from existing disclosure frameworks where possible and appropriate. The FSB also noted the Task Force should determine whether the target audience of users of climate-related financial disclosures should extend beyond investors, lenders, and insurance underwriters. Investors, lenders, and insurance underwriters (“primary users”) are the appropriate target audience. These primary users assume the financial risk and reward of the 14 FSB, “FSB to establish Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures,” December 4, 2015. 15 Ibid. 16 FSB, “Proposal for a Disclosure Task Force on Climate-Related Risks,” November 9, 2015. 17 The term carbon-related assets is not well defined, but is generally considered to refer to assets or organizations with relatively high direct or indirect GHG emissions.

The Task Force recognizes that many other organizations, including credit rating agencies, equity analysts, stock exchanges, investment consultants, and proxy advisors also use climate-related financial disclosures, allowing them to push information through the credit and investment chain and contribute to the better pricing of risks by investors, lenders, and insurance underwriters. These organizations, in principle, depend on the same types of information as primary users. This report presents the Task Force’s recommendations for climate-related financial disclosures and includes supporting information on climate-related risks and opportunities, scenario analysis, and industry feedback that the Task Force considered in developing and then finalizing its recommendations. In addition, the Task Force developed a “stand-alone\" document— Implementing the Recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (Annex)—for organizations to use when preparing disclosures consistent with the recommendations. The Annex provides supplemental guidance for the financial sector as well as for non-financial groups potentially most affected by climate change and the transition to a lower- carbon economy.

      "text": "B Climate-Related Risks, Opportunities, and Financial Impacts Through its work, the Task Force identified a growing demand by investors, lenders, insurance underwriters, and other stakeholders for decision-useful, climate-related financial information. Improved disclosure of climate-related risks and opportunities will provide investors, lenders, insurance underwriters, and other stakeholders with the metrics and information needed to undertake robust and consistent analyses of the potential financial impacts of climate change. The Task Force found that while several climate-related disclosure frameworks have emerged across different jurisdictions in an effort to meet the growing demand for such information, there is a need for a standardized framework to promote alignment across existing regimes and G20 jurisdictions and to provide a common framework for climate-related financial disclosures. An important element of such a framework is the consistent categorization of climate-related risks and opportunities. As a result, the Task Force defined categories for climate-related risks and climate-related opportunities. The Task Force’s recommendations serve to encourage organizations to evaluate and disclose, as part of their annual financial filing preparation and reporting processes, the climate-related risks and opportunities that are most pertinent to their A Introduction business activities. The main climate-related risks and opportunities that organizations should consider are described below and in Tables 1 and 2 (pp. 10-11). B Climate-Related Risks, Opportunities, and Financial Impacts 1. Climate-Related Risks The Task Force divided climate-related risks into two major categories: (1) risks related to the C transition to a lower-carbon economy and (2) risks related to the physical impacts of climate Recommendations and Guidance change. D a. Transition Risks Scenario Analysis and Transitioning to a lower-carbon economy may entail extensive policy, legal, technology, and Climate-Related Issues market changes to address mitigation and adaptation requirements related to climate change. E Depending on the nature, speed, and focus of these changes, transition risks may pose varying Key Issues Considered and levels of financial and reputational risk to organizations. Areas for Further Work Policy and Legal Risks F Conclusion Policy actions around climate change continue to evolve. Their objectives generally fall into two categories—policy actions that attempt to constrain actions that contribute to the adverse effects Appendices of climate change or policy actions that seek to promote adaptation to climate change. Some examples include implementing carbon-pricing mechanisms to reduce GHG emissions, shifting energy use toward lower emission sources, adopting energy-efficiency solutions, encouraging greater water efficiency measures, and promoting more sustainable land-use practices.

Some examples include implementing carbon-pricing mechanisms to reduce GHG emissions, shifting energy use toward lower emission sources, adopting energy-efficiency solutions, encouraging greater water efficiency measures, and promoting more sustainable land-use practices. The risk associated with and financial impact of policy changes depend on the nature and timing of the policy change.21 Another important risk is litigation or legal risk. Recent years have seen an increase in climate- related litigation claims being brought before the courts by property owners, municipalities, states, insurers, shareholders, and public interest organizations.22 Reasons for such litigation include the failure of organizations to mitigate impacts of climate change, failure to adapt to climate change, and the insufficiency of disclosure around material financial risks. As the value of loss and damage arising from climate change grows, litigation risk is also likely to increase. 21 Organizations should assess not only the potential direct effects of policy actions on their operations, but also the potential second and third order effects on their supply and distribution chains. 22 Peter Seley, “Emerging Trends in Climate Change Litigation,” Law 360, March 7, 2016.

      "text": "Technology Risk Technological improvements or innovations that support the transition to a lower-carbon, energy- efficient economic system can have a significant impact on organizations. For example, the development and use of emerging technologies such as renewable energy, battery storage, energy efficiency, and carbon capture and storage will affect the competitiveness of certain organizations, their production and distribution costs, and ultimately the demand for their products and services from end users. To the extent that new technology displaces old systems and disrupts some parts of the existing economic system, winners and losers will emerge from this “creative destruction” process. The timing of technology development and deployment, however, is a key uncertainty in assessing technology risk. Market Risk While the ways in which markets could be affected by climate change are varied and complex, one of the major ways is through shifts in supply and demand for certain commodities, products, and services as climate-related risks and opportunities are increasingly taken into account. Reputation Risk Climate change has been identified as a potential source of reputational risk tied to changing A customer or community perceptions of an organization’s contribution to or detraction from the Introduction transition to a lower-carbon economy. B Climate-Related Risks, b. Physical Risks Opportunities, and Physical risks resulting from climate change can be event driven (acute) or longer-term shifts Financial Impacts (chronic) in climate patterns. Physical risks may have financial implications for organizations, such C as direct damage to assets and indirect impacts from supply chain disruption. Organizations’ Recommendations and financial performance may also be affected by changes in water availability, sourcing, and quality; Guidance food security; and extreme temperature changes affecting organizations’ premises, operations, supply chain, transport needs, and employee safety. D Scenario Analysis and Climate-Related Issues Acute Risk Acute physical risks refer to those that are event-driven, including increased severity of extreme E weather events, such as cyclones, hurricanes, or floods. Key Issues Considered and Areas for Further Work Chronic Risk F Chronic physical risks refer to longer-term shifts in climate patterns (e.g., sustained higher Conclusion temperatures) that may cause sea level rise or chronic heat waves. Appendices 2. Climate-Related Opportunities Efforts to mitigate and adapt to climate change also produce opportunities for organizations, for example, through resource efficiency and cost savings, the adoption of low-emission energy sources, the development of new products and services, access to new markets, and building resilience along the supply chain.

Climate-related opportunities will vary depending on the region, market, and industry in which an organization operates. The Task Force identified several areas of opportunity as described below. a. Resource Efficiency There is growing evidence and examples of organizations that have successfully reduced operating costs by improving efficiency across their production and distribution processes, buildings, machinery/appliances, and transport/mobility—in particular in relation to energy efficiency but also including broader materials, water, and waste management.23 Such actions can 23 UNEP and Copenhagen Centre for Energy Efficiency, Best Practices and Case Studies for Industrial Energy Efficiency Improvement, February 16, 2016.

Energy Source According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), to meet global emission-reduction goals, countries will need to transition a major percentage of their energy generation to low emission alternatives such as wind, solar, wave, tidal, hydro, geothermal, nuclear, biofuels, and carbon capture and storage.26 For the fifth year in a row, investments in renewable energy capacity have exceeded investments in fossil fuel generation.27 The trend toward decentralized clean energy sources, rapidly declining costs, improved storage capabilities, and subsequent global adoption of these technologies are significant. Organizations that shift their energy usage toward low emission energy sources could potentially save on annual energy costs.28 c. Products and Services A Introduction Organizations that innovate and develop new low-emission products and services may improve their competitive position and capitalize on shifting consumer and producer preferences. Some B examples include consumer goods and services that place greater emphasis on a product’s Climate-Related Risks, carbon footprint in its marketing and labeling (e.g., travel, food, beverage and consumer staples, Opportunities, and Financial Impacts mobility, printing, fashion, and recycling services) and producer goods that place emphasis on reducing emissions (e.g., adoption of energy-efficiency measures along the supply chain).

F Conclusion e. Resilience Appendices The concept of climate resilience involves organizations developing adaptive capacity to respond to climate change to better manage the associated risks and seize opportunities, including the ability to respond to transition risks and physical risks. Opportunities include improving efficiency, designing new production processes, and developing new products. Opportunities related to resilience may be especially relevant for organizations with long-lived fixed assets or extensive supply or distribution networks; those that depend critically on utility and infrastructure networks or natural resources in their value chain; and those that may require longer-term financing and investment. 24 Environmental Protection Agency Victoria (EPA Victoria), “Resource Efficiency Case Studies: Lower your Impact.” 25 As described by Pearce and Turner, circular economy refers to a system in which resource input and waste, emission, and energy leakage are minimized. This can be achieved through long-lasting design, maintenance, repair, reuse, remanufacturing, refurbishing, and recycling. This is in contrast to a linear economy which is a “take, make, dispose” model of production. 26 IEA, “Global energy investment down 8% in 2015 with flows signaling move towards cleaner energy,” September 14, 2016. 27 Frankfurt School-United Nations Environmental Programme Centre and Bloomberg New Energy Finance, “Global Trends in Renewable Energy Investment 2017,” 2017. 28 Ceres, “Power Forward 3.0: How the largest US companies are capturing business value while addressing climate change,” 2017. 29 G20 Green Finance Study Group.

In order to make more informed financial decisions, investors, lenders, and insurance underwriters need to understand how climate-related risks and opportunities are likely to impact an organization’s future financial position as reflected in its income statement, cash flow statement, and balance sheet as outlined in Figure 1. While climate change affects nearly all economic sectors, the level and type of exposure and the impact of climate-related risks differs by sector, industry, geography, and organization.30 Figure 1 Climate-Related Risks, Opportunities, and Financial Impact Transition Risks Opportunities Policy and Legal Resource Efficiency Technology Energy Source Market Risks Opportunities Products/Services Reputation A Markets I ntroduction P A h c y u s t i e c al Risks Strategic Planning Resilience Risk Management B Chronic Climate-Related Risks, Opportunities, and Financial Impact Financial Impacts C R G e u c id o a m n m ce e ndations and R Ex e p ve e n n u d e it s u res St I a n t c e o m m e e n t S C t a a s t h e m Fl e o n w t B S a h la e n e c t e C A a ss p e it t a s l & & L F i i a n b a i n lit c i i e n s g D Scenario Analysis and Climate-Related Issues Fundamentally, the financial impacts of climate-related issues on an organization are driven by the specific climate-related risks and opportunities to which the organization is exposed and its E Key Issues Considered and strategic and risk management decisions on managing those risks (i.e., mitigate, transfer, accept, Areas for Further Work or control) and seizing those opportunities.

Conclusion Appendices The financial impacts of climate-related issues on organizations are not always clear or direct, and, for many organizations, identifying the issues, assessing potential impacts, and ensuring material issues are reflected in financial filings may be challenging.

      "text": "C Recommendations and Guidance 1. Overview of Recommendations and Guidance To fulfill its remit, the Task Force developed four widely adoptable recommendations on climate- related financial disclosures applicable to organizations across sectors and jurisdictions. In developing its recommendations, the Task Force considered the challenges for preparers of disclosures as well as the benefits of such disclosures to investors, lenders, and insurance underwriters. To achieve this balance, the Task Force engaged in significant outreach and consultation with users and preparers of disclosures and drew upon existing climate-related disclosure regimes. The insights gained from the outreach and consultations directly informed the development of the recommendations. The Task Force structured its recommendations around four thematic areas that represent core elements of how organizations operate—governance, strategy, risk management, and metrics and targets. The four overarching recommendations are supported by key climate-related financial disclosures—referred to as recommended disclosures—that build out the framework A with information that will help investors and others understand how reporting organizations think Introduction about and assess climate-related risks and opportunities. In addition, there is guidance to support all organizations in developing climate-related financial disclosures consistent with the B recommendations and recommended disclosures as well as supplemental guidance for specific Climate-Related Risks, Opportunities, and sectors. The structure is depicted in Figure 3 below, and the Task Force’s recommendations and Financial Impacts supporting recommended disclosures are presented in Figure 4 (p. 14).

The Task Force developed supplemental guidance for the financial sector, which it organized into four major industries largely based on activities performed. The four industries are banks (lending), insurance companies (underwriting), asset managers (asset management), and asset owners, which include public- and private-sector pension plans, endowments, and foundations (investing).34 The Task Force believes that disclosures by the financial sector could foster an early assessment of climate-related risks and opportunities, improve pricing of climate-related risks, and lead to more informed capital allocation decisions.  Non-Financial Groups. The Task Force developed supplemental guidance for non-financial industries that account for the largest proportion of GHG emissions, energy usage, and water usage. These industries were organized into four groups (i.e., non-financial groups)—Energy; Materials and Buildings; Transportation; and Agriculture, Food, and Forest Products—based on similarities in climate-related risks as shown in Box 2 (p. 16). While this supplemental A guidance focuses on a subset of non-financial industries, organizations in other industries Introduction with similar business activities may wish to review and consider the issues and topics contained in the supplemental guidance.

      "text": "Box 2 Determination of Non-Financial Groups In an effort to focus supplemental guidance on those non-financial sectors and industries with the highest likelihood of climate-related financial impacts, the Task Force assessed three factors most likely to be affected by both transition risk (policy and legal,technology, market, and reputation) and physical risk (acute and chronic)— GHG emissions, energy usage, and water usage. The underlying premise in using these three factors is that climate-related physical and transition risks will likely manifest themselves primarily and broadly in the form of constraints on GHG emissions, effects on energy production and usage, and effects on water availability, usage, and quality. Other factors, such as waste management and land use, are also important, but may not be as determinative across a wide range of industries or may be captured in one of the primary categories. In taking this approach, the Task Force consulted a number of sources regarding the ranking of various sectors and industries according to these three factors. The various rankings were used to determine an overall set of sectors and industries that have significant exposure to transition or physical risks related to GHG emissions, energy, or water. The sectors and industries were grouped into four categories of industries that have similar economic activities and climate-related exposures. These four groups and their associated industries are intended to be indicative of the economic activities associated with these industries rather than definitive industry categories. Other industries with similar activities and climate-related exposures should consider the supplemental guidance as well. The Task Force validated its approach using a variety of sources, including: 1 The TCFD Phase I report public consultation, soliciting more than 200 responses which ranked Energy, Utilities, Materials, Industrials and Consumer Staples/Discretionary, in that order, as the Global Industry Classification Standard (GICS) sectors most important for disclosure guidelines to cover. 2 Numerous sector-specific disclosure guidance documents to understand various breakdowns by economic activity, sector, and industries, including from the following sources: CDP, GHG Protocol, Global Real Estate Sustainability Benchmark (GRESB), Global Reporting Initiative (GRI), Institutional Investors Group on Climate Change (IIGCC), IPIECA (the global oil and gas industry association for environmental and social issues), and the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB). 3 The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report “Climate Change 2014 – Mitigation of Climate Change” that provides an analysis of global direct and indirect emissions by economic sector.

The IPCC analysis highlights the dominant emissions-producing sectors as Energy; Industry; Agriculture, Forestry, and Other Land Use; and Transportation and Buildings (Commercial and Residential). 4 Research and documentation from non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and industry organizations that provide information on which industries have the highest exposures to climate change, including those from Cambridge Institute of Sustainability Leadership, China’s National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC), Environmental Resources Management (ERM), IEA, Moody’s, S&P Global Ratings, and WRI/UNEPFI.

      "text": "2. Implementing the Recommendations a. Scope of Coverage To promote more informed investing, lending, and insurance underwriting decisions, the Task Force recommends all organizations with public debt or equity implement its recommendations. Because climate-related issues are relevant for other types of organizations as well, the Task Force encourages all organizations to implement these recommendations. In particular, the Task Force believes that asset managers and asset owners, including public- and private-sector pension plans, endowments, and foundations, should implement its recommendations so that their clients and beneficiaries may better understand the performance of their assets, consider the risks of their investments, and make more informed investment choices. b. Location of Disclosures and Materiality The Task Force recommends that organizations provide climate-related financial disclosures in their mainstream (i.e., public) annual financial filings.35 In most G20 jurisdictions, public companies have a legal obligation to disclose material information in their financial filings— including material climate-related information; and the Task Force’s recommendations are A intended to help organizations meet existing disclosure obligations more effectively.36 The Task Introduction Force’s recommendations were developed to apply broadly across sectors and jurisdictions and should not be seen as superseding national disclosure requirements. Importantly, organizations B should make financial disclosures in accordance with their national disclosure requirements. If Climate-Related Risks, Opportunities, and certain elements of the recommendations are incompatible with national disclosure Financial Impacts requirements for financial filings, the Task Force encourages organizations to disclose those elements in other official company reports that are issued at least annually, widely distributed C and available to investors and others, and subject to internal governance processes that are the Recommendations and Guidance same or substantially similar to those used for financial reporting. D The Task Force recognizes that most information included in financial filings is subject to a Scenario Analysis and materiality assessment. However, because climate-related risk is a non-diversifiable risk that Climate-Related Issues affects nearly all industries, many investors believe it requires special attention. For example, in E assessing organizations’ financial and operating results, many investors want insight into the Key Issues Considered and governance and risk management context in which such results are achieved. The Task Force Areas for Further Work believes disclosures related to its Governance and Risk Management recommendations directly address this need for context and should be included in annual financial filings.

F Conclusion For disclosures related to the Strategy and Metrics and Targets recommendations, the Task Force Appendices believes organizations should provide such information in annual financial filings when the information is deemed material. Certain organizations—those in the four non-financial groups that have more than one billion U.S. dollar equivalent (USDE) in annual revenue—should consider disclosing such information in other reports when the information is not deemed material and not included in financial filings.37 Because these organizations are more likely than others to be financially impacted over time, investors are interested in monitoring how these organizations’ strategies evolve. 35 Financial filings refer to the annual reporting packages in which organizations are required to deliver their audited financial results under the corporate, compliance, or securities laws of the jurisdictions in which they operate. While reporting requirements differ internationally, financial filings generally contain financial statements and other information such as governance statements and management commentary. 36 The Task Force encourages organizations where climate-related issues could be material in the future to begin disclosing climate-related financial information outside financial filings to facilitate the incorporation of such information into financial filings once climate-related issues are determined to be material. 37 The Task Force chose a one billion USDE annual revenue threshold because it captures organizations responsible for over 90 percent of Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions in the industries represented by the four non-financial groups (about 2,250 organizations out of roughly 15,000).

      "text": "The Task Force recognizes reporting by asset managers and asset owners is intended to satisfy the needs of clients, beneficiaries, regulators, and oversight bodies and follows a format that is generally different from corporate financial reporting. For purposes of adopting the Task Force’s recommendations, asset managers and asset owners should use their existing means of financial reporting to their clients and beneficiaries where relevant and where feasible. Likewise, asset managers and asset owners should consider materiality in the context of their respective mandates and investment performance for clients and beneficiaries.38 The Task Force believes that climate-related financial disclosures should be subject to appropriate internal governance processes. Since these disclosures should be included in annual financial filings, the governance processes should be similar to those used for existing financial reporting and would likely involve review by the chief financial officer and audit committee, as appropriate. The Task Force recognizes that some organizations may provide some or all of their climate- related financial disclosures in reports other than financial filings. This may occur because the organizations are not required to issue public financial reports (e.g., some asset managers and asset owners). In such situations, organizations should follow internal governance processes that are the same or substantially similar to those used for financial reporting. A Introduction c.

As a result, organizations with significant emissions are likely to be impacted more significantly by transition risk than other organizations. In addition, current or future constraints on emissions, either directly by emission restrictions or indirectly through carbon budgets, may impact organizations financially. 40 While challenges remain, the GHG Protocol methodology is the most widely recognized and used international standard for calculating GHG emissions. Organizations may use national reporting methodologies if they are consistent with the GHG Protocol methodology. 41 For industries with high energy consumption, metrics related to emission intensity are important to provide. For example, emissions per unit of economic output (e.g., unit of production, number of employees, or value-added) is widely used. See the Annex for examples of metrics.

      "text": "D Scenario Analysis and Climate-Related Issues Some organizations are affected by risks associated with climate change today. However, for many organizations, the most significant effects of climate change are likely to emerge over the medium to longer term and their timing and magnitude are uncertain. This uncertainty presents challenges for individual organizations in understanding the potential effects of climate change on their businesses, strategies, and financial performance. To appropriately incorporate the potential effects in their planning processes, organizations need to consider how their climate- related risks and opportunities may evolve and the potential implications under different conditions. One way to do this is through scenario analysis. Scenario analysis is a well-established method for developing strategic plans that are more flexible or robust to a range of plausible future states. The use of scenario analysis for assessing the potential business implications of climate-related risks and opportunities, however, is relatively recent. While several organizations use scenario analysis to assess the potential impact of climate change on their businesses, only a subset have disclosed their assessment of forward- looking implications publicly, either in sustainability reports or financial filings.42 A Introduction The disclosure of organizations’ forward-looking assessments of climate-related issues is important for investors and other stakeholders in understanding how vulnerable individual B Climate-Related Risks, organizations are to transition and physical risks and how such vulnerabilities are or would be Opportunities, and addressed.

Exposure to Transition Risks Transition risk scenarios are particularly relevant for resource-intensive organizations with high GHG emissions within their value chains, where policy actions, technology, or market changes aimed at emissions reductions, energy efficiency, subsidies or taxes, or other constraints or incentives may have a particularly direct effect. A key type of transition risk scenario is a so-called 2°C scenario, which lays out a pathway and an emissions trajectory consistent with holding the increase in the global average temperature to 2°C above pre-industrial levels. In December 2015, nearly 200 governments agreed to strengthen the global response to the threat of climate change by “holding the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2°C above pre-industrial levels and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels,” referred to as the Paris Agreement.45 As a result, a 2°C scenario provides a common reference point that is generally aligned with the objectives of the Paris Agreement and will support investors’ evaluation of the potential magnitude and timing of transition-related implications for individual organizations; across A different organizations within a sector; and across different sectors.

The Task Force recognizes that, for many organizations, scenario analysis is or would be a largely qualitative exercise. However, organizations with more significant exposure to transition risk and/or physical risk should undertake more rigorous qualitative and, if relevant, quantitative scenario analysis with respect to key drivers and trends that affect their operations. A critical aspect of scenario analysis is the selection of a set of scenarios (not just one) that covers a reasonable variety of future outcomes, both favorable and unfavorable.

For an organization in the initial stages of implementing scenario analysis or with limited exposure to climate-related issues, the Task Force recommends disclosing how resilient, qualitatively or directionally, the organization’s strategy and financial plans may be to a range of relevant climate change scenarios. This information helps investors, lenders, insurance underwriters, and other stakeholders understand the robustness of an organization’s forward- looking strategy and financial plans across a range of possible future states. Organizations with more significant exposure to climate-related issues should consider disclosing key assumptions and pathways related to the scenarios they use to allow users to understand the analytical process and its limitations.

Applying Scenario Analysis While the Task Force recognizes the complexities of scenario analysis and the potential resources needed to conduct it, organizations are encouraged to use scenario analysis to assess climate- related risks and opportunities. For organizations just beginning to use scenario analysis, a qualitative approach that progresses and deepens over time may be appropriate.48 Greater rigor and sophistication in the use of data and quantitative models and analysis may be warranted for organizations with more extensive experience in conducting scenario analysis. Organizations may decide to use existing external scenarios and models (e.g., those provided by third-party vendors) or develop their own, in-house modeling capabilities. The choice of approach will depend on an organization’s needs, resources, and capabilities. In conducting scenario analysis, organizations should strive to achieve:  transparency around parameters, assumptions, analytical approaches, and time frames;  comparability of results across different scenarios and analytical approaches;  adequate documentation for the methodology, assumptions, data sources, and analytics; A  consistency of methodology year over year; Introduction  sound governance over scenario analysis conduct, validation, approval, and application; and B Climate-Related Risks,  effective disclosure of scenario analysis that will inform and promote a constructive Opportunities, and dialogue between investors and organizations on the range of potential impacts and Financial Impacts resilience of the organization’s strategy under various plausible climate-related scenarios.

Challenges and Benefits of Conducting Scenario Analysis Scenario analysis is a well-established method for developing strategic plans that are more flexible and robust to a range of plausible future states. As previously discussed (Figure 7, p. 26) it is particularly useful for assessing issues with possible outcomes that are highly uncertain, that play out over the medium to longer term, and that are potentially disruptive. Scenario analysis can help to better frame strategic issues, assess the range of potential management actions that may be needed, engage more productively in strategic conversations, and identify indicators to monitor the external environment. Importantly, climate-related scenario analysis can provide the foundation for more effective engagement with investors on an organization’s strategic and business resiliency. Conducting climate-related scenario analysis, however, is not without challenges. First, most scenarios have been developed for global and macro assessments of potential climate-related impacts that can inform policy makers. These climate-related scenarios do not always provide the ideal level of transparency, range of data outputs, and functionality of tools that would facilitate their use in a business or investment context. Second, the availability and granularity of data can be a challenge for organizations attempting to A Introduction assess various energy and technology pathways or carbon constraints in different jurisdictions and geographic locations.

Relationship to Other Reporting Initiatives Through the Task Force’s outreach efforts, some organizations expressed concern that multiple disclosure frameworks and mandatory reporting requirements increase the administrative burden of disclosure efforts. Specifically, the additional time, cost, and effort required to analyze and disclose new climate-related information could penalize those with less capacity to respond. The Task Force considered existing voluntary and mandatory climate-related reporting frameworks in developing its recommendations and provides information in the Annex on the alignment of existing frameworks, including those developed by the CDP (formerly the Carbon Disclosure Project), Climate Disclosure Standards Board (CDSB), the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI), the International Integrated Reporting Council (IIRC), and the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB), with the Task Force’s recommended disclosures. The Task Force expects preparers disclosing climate-related information under other regimes will be able to use existing processes and content when developing disclosures based on the Task Force’s recommendations. The Task Force’s recommendations provide a common set of principles that should help existing disclosure regimes come into closer alignment over time. Preparers, users, and other A stakeholders share a common interest in encouraging such alignment as it relieves a burden for Introduction reporting entities, reduces fragmented disclosure, and provides greater comparability for users. The Task Force also encourages standard setting bodies to support adoption of the B recommendations and alignment with the recommended disclosures.

As part of the Task Force’s second public consultation, some organizations expressed concern about disclosing information in financial filings that is not clearly tied to an assessment of materiality. The Task Force recognizes organizations’ concerns about disclosing information in annual financial filings that is not clearly tied to an assessment of materiality. However, the Task Force believes disclosures related to the Governance and Risk Management recommendations should be provided in annual financial filings. Because climate-related risk is a non-diversifiable risk that affects nearly all sectors, many investors believe it requires special attention. For example, in assessing organizations’ financial and operating results, many investors want insight into the governance and risk management context in which such results are achieved. The Task Force believes disclosures related to its Governance and Risk Management recommendations directly address this need for context and should be included in annual financial filings.

Scenario Analysis As part of the Task Force’s second public consultation, many organizations said scenario analysis is a useful tool to help assess risks and understand potential implications of climate change; however, they also identified areas where the Task Force’s recommendations and guidance could be improved. In particular, organizations asked the Task Force to identify standardized climate- related scenarios for organizations to use and clarify the information related to scenarios that should be disclosed. They also noted expectations around disclosures and climate-related scenario analysis should be proportionate to the size of the reporting entity and not onerous for smaller organizations. In addition, some organizations noted that the disclosures related to strategy could put organizations at greater risk of litigation given the high degree of uncertainty around the future timing and magnitude of climate-related impacts. In finalizing its recommendations and guidance, the Task Force clarified organizations should describe how resilient their strategies are to climate-related risks and opportunities, taking into consideration a transition to a lower-carbon economy consistent with a 2°C or lower scenario and, where relevant, scenarios consistent with more extreme physical risks. To address concerns about proportionality, the Task Force established a threshold for organizations in the four non- A financial groups that should perform more robust scenario analysis and disclose additional Introduction information on the resiliency of their strategies. B On the issue of recommending specific standardized or reference climate-related scenarios for Climate-Related Risks, Opportunities, and organizations to use, Task Force members agreed that while such an approach is intuitively Financial Impacts appealing, it is not a practical solution at this time.

Data Availability and Quality and Financial Impact The Task Force developed supplemental guidance for the four non-financial groups that account for the largest proportion of GHG emissions, energy usage, and water usage; and, as part of that supplemental guidance, the Task Force included several illustrative metrics around factors that may be indicative of potential financial implications for climate-related risks and opportunities. As part of the second public consultation, several organizations provided feedback on the illustrative metrics, and common themes included (1) improving the comparability and consistency of the metrics, (2) clarifying the links among the metrics, climate-related risks and opportunities, and potential financial implications, (3) simplifying the metrics, and (4) providing additional guidance on the metrics, including how to calculate key metrics.

Conclusion As part of the Task Force’s public consultation as well as in discussions with preparers, some asset Appendices owners and asset managers expressed concern about reporting on GHG emissions related to their own or their clients’ investments given the current data challenges and existing accounting guidance on how to measure and report GHG emissions associated with investments. In particular, they voiced concerns about the accuracy and completeness of the reported data and limited application of the metric to asset classes beyond public equities. Organizations also highlighted that GHG emissions associated with investments cannot be used as a sole indicator for investment decisions (i.e., additional metrics are needed) and that the metric can fluctuate with share price movements since it uses investors’ proportional share of total equity.57 In consideration of the feedback received, the Task Force has replaced the GHG emissions associated with investments metric in the supplemental guidance for asset owners and asset managers with a weighted average carbon intensity metric. The Task Force believes the weighted 55 Scope 3 emissions are all indirect emissions that occur in the value chain of the reporting company, including both upstream and downstream emissions. See Greenhouse Gas Protocol, “Calculation Tools, FAQ.” 56 Product life cycle emissions are all the emissions associated with the production and use of a specific product, including emissions from raw materials, manufacture, transport, storage, sale, use, and disposal. See Greenhouse Gas Protocol, “Calculation Tools, FAQ.” 57 Because the metric uses investors’ proportional share of total equity, increases in the underlying companies’ share prices, all else equal, will result in a decrease in the carbon footprinting number even though GHG emissions are unchanged.

For example, the metric can be applied across asset classes, is fairly simple to calculate, and does not use investors’ proportional share of total equity and, therefore, is not sensitive to share price movements. The Task Force acknowledges the challenges and limitations of current carbon footprinting metrics, including that such metrics should not necessarily be interpreted as risk metrics. Nevertheless, the Task Force views the reporting of weighted average carbon intensity as a first step and expects disclosure of this information to prompt important advancements in the development of decision-useful, climate-related risk metrics. In this regard, the Task Force encourages asset owners and asset managers to provide other metrics they believe are useful for decision making along with a description of the methodology used. The Task Force recognizes that some asset owners and asset managers may be able to report the weighted average carbon intensity and other metrics on only a portion of their investments given data availability and methodological issues. Nonetheless, increasing the number of organizations reporting this type of information should help speed the development of better climate-related risk metrics. A Introduction 6. Remuneration In the supplemental guidance for the Energy Group, the Task Force asked such organizations to B Climate-Related Risks, consider disclosing whether and how performance metrics, including links to remuneration Opportunities, and policies, take into consideration climate-related risks and opportunities. As part of its second Financial Impacts public consultation, the Task Force asked whether the guidance should extend to organizations C beyond those in the Energy group and, if so, to which types of organizations. The majority of Recommendations and organizations that commented on this issue responded that the guidance should be extended to Guidance other organizations; and many suggested that the guidance should apply to organizations more likely to be affected by climate-related risks. In consideration of the feedback received, the Task D Scenario Analysis and Force revised its guidance to ask organizations, where climate-related risks are material, to Climate-Related Issues consider describing whether and how related performance metrics are incorporated into remuneration policies.

Both International Accounting Standard (IAS) 37 “Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets” and Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 450 “Contingencies” provide guidance on how to account for and disclose contingencies. Additionally, IAS 36 “Impairment of Assets” and ASC 360 “Long-lived Asset Impairment” provide guidance on assessing the impairment of long-lived assets. The disclosures of both contingencies and management’s assessment and evaluation of long-lived assets for potential impairment are critically important in assisting stakeholders in understanding an organization’s ability to meet future reported earnings and cash flow goals. In most G20 countries, financial executives will likely recognize that the Task Force’s disclosure recommendations should result in more quantitative financial disclosures, particularly disclosure of metrics, about the financial impact that climate-related risks have or could have on an organization. Specifically, asset impairments may result from assets adversely impacted by the effects of climate change and/or additional liabilities may need to be recorded to account for regulatory fines and penalties resulting from enhanced regulatory standards.

Therefore, financial executives (e.g., chief financial officers, chief accounting officers, and controllers) should be involved in the organization’s evaluation of climate-related risks and opportunities and the efforts undertaken to manage the risks and maximize the opportunities. Finally, careful consideration should be given to the linkage between scenario analyses performed to assess the resilience of an organization’s strategy to climate-related risks and opportunities (as suggested in the Task Force’s recommendations) and assumptions underlying cash flow analyses used to assess asset (e.g., goodwill, intangibles, and fixed assets) impairments. 8. Time Frames for Short, Medium, and Long Term As part of the Task Force’s second public consultation, some organizations asked the Task Force to define specific ranges for short, medium, and long term. Because the timing of climate-related impacts on organizations will vary, the Task Force believes specifying time frames across sectors for short, medium, and long term could hinder organizations’ consideration of climate-related risks and opportunities specific to their businesses. The Task Force is, therefore, not defining time frames and encourages preparers to decide how to define their own time frames according to the A life of their assets, the profile of the climate-related risks they face, and the sectors and Introduction geographies in which they operate. B Climate-Related Risks, In assessing climate-related issues, organizations should be sensitive to the time frames used to Opportunities, and conduct their assessments.

Even for organizations with clearly assigned responsibilities for climate-related issues, the relationship between those responsible for climate-related risk (e.g., “environmental, social and governance” experts, chief investment officers) and those in the finance function can range from regularly scheduled interactions and exchanges of information to minimal or no interaction.

A 1. Evolution of Climate-Related Financial Disclosures Introduction The Task Force recognizes that challenges exist, but all types of organizations can develop B disclosures consistent with its recommendations. The recommendations provide a foundation for Climate-Related Risks, immediate adoption and are flexible enough to accommodate evolving practices. As Opportunities, and Financial Impacts understanding, data analytics, and modeling of climate-related issues become more widespread, disclosures can mature accordingly. C Recommendations and Organizations already reporting climate-related financial information under other frameworks Guidance may be well positioned to disclose under this framework immediately and are encouraged to do D so. For such organizations, significant effort has gone into developing processes and collecting Scenario Analysis and information needed for disclosing under these regimes. The Task Force expects these Climate-Related Issues organizations will be able to use existing processes when providing disclosures in annual financial E filings based on the Task Force’s recommendations.59,60 Those with less experience can begin by Key Issues Considered and considering and disclosing how climate-related issues may be relevant in their current Areas for Further Work governance, strategy, and risk management practices. This initial level of disclosure will allow investors to review, recognize, and understand how organizations consider climate-related issues F Conclusion and their potential financial impact. Appendices Importantly, the Task Force recognizes organizations need to make financial disclosures in accordance with their national disclosure requirements. To the extent certain elements of the recommendations are incompatible with national disclosure requirements for financial filings, the Task Force encourages organizations to disclose those elements through other reports. Such other reports should be official company reports that are issued at least annually, widely distributed and available to investors and others, and subject to internal governance processes that are the same or substantially similar to those used for financial reporting. 2.

Through widespread adoption, financial risks and opportunities related to climate change will become a natural part of 59 The Task Force recognizes the structure and content of financial filings differs across jurisdictions and, therefore, believes organizations are in the best position to determine where and how the recommended disclosures should be incorporated in financial filings. 60 The Task Force encourages organizations where climate-related issues could be material in the future to begin disclosing climate-related financial information outside financial filings to facilitate the incorporation of such information into financial filings once climate-related issues are determined to be material.

As this occurs, organizations’ and investors’ understanding of the potential financial implications associated with transitioning to a lower-carbon economy and physical risks will grow, information will become more decision- useful, and risks and opportunities will be more accurately priced, allowing for the more efficient allocation of capital. Figure 12 outlines a possible path for implementation. Widespread adoption of the recommendations will require ongoing leadership by the G20 and its member countries. Such leadership is essential to continue to make the link between these recommendations and the achievements of global climate objectives. Leadership from the FSB is also critical to underscore the importance of better climate-related financial disclosures for the functioning of the financial system.

A variety of stakeholders, including stock exchanges, investment consultants, credit rating agencies, and others can provide valuable contributions toward adoption of the recommendations. The Task Force believes that advocacy for these standards will be necessary for widespread adoption, including educating organizations that will disclose climate-related financial information and those that will use those disclosures to make financial decisions. To this end, the Task Force notes that strong support by the FSB and G20 authorities would have a positive impact on implementation. With the FSB’s extension of the Task Force through September 2018, the Task Force will work to encourage adoption of the recommendations and support the FSB and G20 authorities in promoting the advancement of climate-related financial disclosures.

Objectives The Task Force engaged with key stakeholders throughout the development of its recommendations to ensure that its work would (1) promote alignment across existing disclosure regimes, (2) consider the perspectives of users and the concerns of preparers of climate-related financial disclosures, and (3) be efficiently implemented by organizations in their financial reporting. 2. Approach In addition to the expertise of its members, a broad range of external resources informed the Task Force’s recommendations, including existing voluntary and mandatory climate-related reporting frameworks, governance and risk management standards, government reports and research, expert resources, and various other stakeholders such as industry participants, trade A associations, and non-governmental organizations (NGOs). Introduction a. Leveraging Expertise B Task Force members come from a range of companies, including large financial companies, large Climate-Related Risks, Opportunities, and non-financial companies, accounting and consulting firms, and credit rating agencies, and Financial Impacts brought a range of practical experience, expertise, and global perspectives on preparing and using climate-related financial disclosures.

Outreach and Engagement Engagement with users, preparers, and other stakeholders in relevant industries and sectors across G20 countries and other countries was important in developing the Task Force’s recommendations. The Task Force conducted five types of engagement to support this effort: public consultation, industry interviews, focus groups, outreach events, and webinars. Such engagement served two primary purposes: (1) to raise the level of awareness and educate stakeholders on the Task Force’s work and (2) to solicit feedback from stakeholders on the Task Force’s proposed recommended disclosures and supplemental guidance for specific sectors. In total, more than 2,700 individuals in 43 countries were included in the Task Force’s outreach and engagement (Figure A2.1). Public Consultations The Task Force conducted two public consultations. The first followed the April 1, 2016 publication of the Task Force’s Phase I Report, which set out the scope and high-level objectives for the Task Force’s work. The Task Force solicited input to guide the development of its recommendations for voluntary climate-related financial disclosures. In total, 203 participants from 24 countries responded to the first public consultation. Respondents represented the financial sector, non- A financial sectors, NGOs, and other organizations. Public consultation comments indicated support Introduction for disclosures on scenario analysis as well as disclosures tailored for specific sectors.

A Webinars Introduction Prior to the release of the report in December 2016 for public consultation, the Task Force offered B seven webinars to educate and increase awareness of the Task Force’s efforts as well as to collect Climate-Related Risks, additional feedback. Of the seven webinars, the Task Force hosted four webinars and participated Opportunities, and Financial Impacts in three additional webinars by partnering with the following organizations: Business for Social Responsibility, Global Financial Markets Association, and the National Association of Corporate C Directors. These webinars served to supplement the in-person outreach events and offered Recommendations and global stakeholders, regardless of location, an opportunity to engage with the Task Force. The Guidance webinars included 538 attendees representing 365 organizations across 23 countries. After the D release of the report, the Task Force held three webinars to present its recommendations and to Scenario Analysis and solicit additional feedback. The three webinars included 255 attendees representing 209 Climate-Related Issues organizations across 25 countries.

      "text": "Appendix 3: Fundamental Principles for Effective Disclosure To underpin its recommendations and help guide current and future developments in climate- related financial reporting, the Task Force developed a set of principles for effective disclosure.63 As understanding of, and approaches to, climate-related issues evolve over time, so too will climate-related financial reporting. These principles can help achieve high-quality and decision-useful disclosures that enable users to understand the impact of climate change on organizations. The Task Force encourages organizations adopting its recommendations to consider these principles as they develop climate-related financial disclosures. The Task Force’s disclosure principles are largely consistent with other mainstream, internationally accepted frameworks for financial reporting and are generally applicable to most providers of financial disclosures. They are informed by the qualitative and quantitative characteristics of financial information and further the overall goals of producing disclosures that are consistent, comparable, reliable, clear, and efficient, as highlighted by the FSB in establishing the Task Force. The principles, taken together, are designed to assist organizations in making clear the linkages and connections between climate-related issues A Introduction and their governance, strategy, risk management, and metrics and targets. B Principle 1: Disclosures should present relevant information Climate-Related Risks, Opportunities, and The organization should provide information specific to the potential impact of climate-related Financial Impacts risks and opportunities on its markets, businesses, corporate or investment strategy, financial statements, and future cash flows. C Recommendations and  Disclosures should be eliminated if they are immaterial or redundant to avoid obscuring Guidance relevant information. However, when a particular risk or issue attracts investor and D market interest or attention, it may be helpful for the organization to include a Scenario Analysis and statement that the risk or issue is not significant. This shows that the risk or issue has Climate-Related Issues been considered and has not been overlooked. E  Disclosures should be presented in sufficient detail to enable users to assess the Key Issues Considered and organization’s exposure and approach to addressing climate-related issues, while Areas for Further Work understanding that the type of information, the way in which it is presented, and the F accompanying notes will differ between organizations and will be subject to change over Conclusion time. Appendices  Climate-related impacts can occur over the short, medium, and long term.

Furthermore, any proposed metrics should adequately describe or serve as a proxy for risk or performance and reflect how an organization manages the risk and opportunities. 63 These principles are adapted from those included in the Enhanced Disclosure Task Force’s “Enhancing the Risk Disclosures of Banks.” Recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures 51",

      "text": "Principle 2: Disclosures should be specific and complete  An organization’s reporting should provide a thorough overview of its exposure to potential climate-related impacts; the potential nature and size of such impacts; the organization’s governance, strategy, processes for managing climate-related risks, and performance with respect to managing climate-related risks and opportunities.  To be sufficiently comprehensive, disclosures should contain historical and future- oriented information in order to allow users to evaluate their previous expectations relative to actual performance and assess possible future financial implications.  For quantitative information, the disclosure should include an explanation of the definition and scope applied. For future-oriented data, this includes clarification of the key assumptions used. Forward-looking quantitative disclosure should align with data used by the organization for investment decision making and risk management.  Any scenario analyses should be based on data or other information used by the organization for investment decision making and risk management. Where appropriate, the organization should also demonstrate the effect on selected risk metrics or A exposures to changes in the key underlying methodologies and assumptions, both in Introduction qualitative and quantitative terms. B Principle 3: Disclosures should be clear, balanced, and understandable Climate-Related Risks, Opportunities, and  Disclosures should be written with the objective of communicating financial information Financial Impacts that serves the needs of a range of financial sector users (e.g., investors, lenders, C insurers, and others). This requires reporting at a level beyond compliance with Recommendations and minimum requirements. The disclosures should be sufficiently granular to inform Guidance sophisticated users, but should also provide concise information for those who are less specialized. Clear communication will allow users to identify key information efficiently.

      "text": "Principle 5: Disclosures should be comparable among organizations within a sector, industry, or portfolio  Disclosures should allow for meaningful comparisons of strategy, business activities, risks, and performance across organizations and within sectors and jurisdictions.  The level of detail provided in disclosures should enable comparison and benchmarking of risks across sectors and at the portfolio level, where appropriate.  The placement of reporting would ideally be consistent across organizations—i.e., in financial filings—in order to facilitate easy access to the relevant information. Principle 6: Disclosures should be reliable, verifiable, and objective  Disclosures should provide high-quality reliable information. They should be accurate and neutral—i.e., free from bias.  Future-oriented disclosures will inherently involve the organization’s judgment (which should be adequately explained). To the extent possible, disclosures should be based on objective data and use best-in-class measurement methodologies, which would include A common industry practice as it evolves. Introduction  Disclosures should be defined, collected, recorded, and analyzed in such a way that the B information reported is verifiable to ensure it is high quality. For future-oriented Climate-Related Risks, information, this means assumptions used can be traced back to their sources. This Opportunities, and Financial Impacts does not imply a requirement for independent external assurance; however, disclosures should be subject to internal governance processes that are the same or substantially C similar to those used for financial reporting. Recommendations and Guidance Principle 7: Disclosures should be provided on a timely basis D Scenario Analysis and  Information should be delivered to users or updated in a timely manner using Climate-Related Issues appropriate media on, at least, an annual basis within the mainstream financial report. E  Climate-related risks can result in disruptive events. In case of such events with a Key Issues Considered and material financial impact, the organization should provide a timely update of climate- Areas for Further Work related disclosures as appropriate. F Reporters may encounter tension in the application of the fundamental principles set out above. Conclusion For example, an organization may update a methodology to meet the comparability principle, which could then result in a conflict with the principle of consistency. Tension can also arise within Appendices a single principle. For example, Principle 6 states that disclosures should be verifiable, but assumptions made about future-oriented disclosures often require significant judgment by management that is difficult to verify. Such tensions are inevitable given the wide-ranging and sometimes competing needs of users and prepar",

Although a complete and comprehensive survey of existing schemes is beyond the scope of this report, the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD or Task Force) considered a broad range of existing frameworks, both voluntary and mandatory. The tables in Appendix 4 outline select disclosure frameworks considered by the Task Force and describe a few key characteristics of each framework, including whether disclosures are mandatory or voluntary, what type of information is reported, who the target reporters and target audiences are, where the disclosed information is placed, and whether there are specified materiality standards.64 These disclosure frameworks were chosen to illustrate the broad range of disclosure regimes around the world; the tables are broken out into disclosure frameworks sponsored by governments, stock exchanges, and non-governmental organizations (NGOs). The information presented in the tables below (A4.1, A4.2, and A4.3) is based on information released by governments, stock exchanges, and standard setters and is supplemented by the A United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), “The Financial System We Need: Aligning the Introduction Financial System with Sustainable Development,” October 2015, and the Organization for B Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), “Report to G20 Finance Ministers and Central Climate-Related Risks, Bank Governors,” September 2015.

Some countries use a two-tiered system where “board” refers to the “supervisory board” while “key executives” refers to the “management board.”65 CLIMATE-RELATED OPPORTUNITY refers to the potential positive impacts related to climate change on an organization. Efforts to mitigate and adapt to climate change can produce opportunities for organizations, such as through resource efficiency and cost savings, the adoption and utilization of low-emission energy sources, the development of new products and services, and building resilience along the supply chain. Climate-related opportunities will vary depending on the region, market, and industry in which an organization operates. CLIMATE-RELATED RISK refers to the potential negative impacts of climate change on an organization. Physical risks emanating from climate change can be event-driven (acute) such as A increased severity of extreme weather events (e.g., cyclones, droughts, floods, and fires). They can Introduction also relate to longer-term shifts (chronic) in precipitation and temperature and increased B variability in weather patterns (e.g., sea level rise). Climate-related risks can also be associated Climate-Related Risks, with the transition to a lower-carbon global economy, the most common of which relate to policy Opportunities, and and legal actions, technology changes, market responses, and reputational considerations. Financial Impacts C FINANCIAL FILINGS refer to the annual reporting packages in which organizations are required Recommendations and to deliver their audited financial results under the corporate, compliance, or securities laws of the Guidance jurisdictions in which they operate.

Scope 3 emissions could include: the extraction and production of purchased materials and fuels, transport-related activities in vehicles not owned or controlled by the reporting entity, electricity-related activities (e.g., transmission and distribution losses), outsourced activities, and waste disposal. 70 INTERNAL CARBON PRICE is an internally developed estimated cost of carbon emissions. Internal carbon pricing can be used as a planning tool to help identify revenue opportunities and risks, as an incentive to drive energy efficiencies to reduce costs, and to guide capital investment decisions. MANAGEMENT refers to those positions an organization views as executive or senior A management positions and that are generally separate from the board.
