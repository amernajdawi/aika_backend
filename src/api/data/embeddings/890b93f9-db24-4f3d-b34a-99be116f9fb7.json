It is useful particularly in feasible, ultimate elimination of unintentionally countries where measurement data are limited, produced POPs. Parties are required to identify, enabling the elaboration of source inventories and characterize, quantify and prioritize sources of release estimates by using the default emission releases of unintentionally produced POPs, and factors. It is also useful in countries where develop strategies with concrete measures, national measurement data are available, as a timelines and goals to minimize or eliminate these reference document for data comparison and releases. validation purposes. To support Parties in meeting these obligations, a The Conference of the Parties at its fifth meeting methodology has been developed to ensure that in 2011 welcomed these revisions and updates, source inventories and release estimates are and Parties were encouraged to use the additional complete, transparent, as well as consistent in guidance. format and content. It allows Parties to compare This edition of the Toolkit contains all new results, identify priorities, mark progress and information, as well as model inventories follow changes over time at the national, regional illustrating relevant processes. In addition, the and global levels. entire Toolkit is now available in an interactive The Standardized Toolkit for Identification and electronic version, with information structured Quantification of Dioxin and Furan Releases was according to the level of technical detail. With first published in 2003 and revised in 2005. In these improvements, we hope the Parties will find 2006, the Conference of the Parties to the the new Toolkit edition more useful and user Stockholm Convention welcomed the second friendly than ever. Toolkit edition and recognized its usefulness. At the same time, Parties acknowledged the need for its ongoing revision and updating, placing emphasis on key sources for which limited data were available and on providing support to developing countries in their efforts to verify their emission factors. Parties also requested overall improvement of the usefulness and user Jim Willis friendliness of the Toolkit. Executive Secretary The revision process was open and inclusive, involving experts nominated by Parties as well as by nongovernmental organizations and industry associations, and in cooperation with UNEP Chemicals. 3",

      "text": "Toolkit for Identification and Quantification of Releases of Dioxins, Furans and Other Unintentional POPs January 2013 PART I GENERAL GUIDANCE Chapter 1 Introduction and Overview Under the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPs), Parties are required to reduce total releases from anthropogenic sources of the chemicals listed in Annex C with the goal of continually minimizing and, where feasible, ultimately eliminating releases of these unintentionally produced chemicals. Toward this end, Parties must develop action plans as part of their National Implementation Plans (NIP) to identify, characterize and address the releases of unintentional POPs listed in Annex C. Action plans to be developed according to Article 5 of the Convention shall include evaluations of current and projected releases that are derived through the development and maintenance of source inventories and release estimates, taking into consideration the source categories listed in Annex C. To achieve the goal of the Convention, Parties are required to implement or promote best available techniques (BAT) and best environmental practices (BEP), as described in the “Guidelines on Best Available Techniques and Provisional Guidance on Best Environmental Practices relevant to Article 5 and Annex C of the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants”. Five years after developing their action plan, Parties are required to review their adopted strategies, including the extent to which their unintentional POPs releases have been reduced, and to incorporate such reviews in national reports pursuant to Article 15. 1.1 Chemicals Listed in Annex C Pursuant to Article 5 of the Convention, the following unintentional POPs are listed in Annex C: • Polychlorinated dibenzo‐p‐dioxins (PCDD) • Polychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDF), • Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB), • Hexachlorobenzene (HCB), and • Pentachlorobenzene (PeCBz).1 Among these, PCDD and PCDF (also collectively referred to as PCDD/PCDF) have never been used as commercial products, nor were intentionally manufactured for any reason other than laboratory purposes. PCB, HCB and PeCBz are also unintentionally formed, usually from the same sources that produce PCDD/PCDF. However, unlike PCDD/PCDF, they have also been manufactured and used for specific purposes, their intentional production and use being by far higher than the unintentional formation and release. PCDD/PCDF releases are accompanied by releases of other unintentional POP",

It is thus recommended, for practical reasons, that inventory activities be focused on PCDD/PCDF, as these substances are indicative of the presence of other unintentional POPs. They are considered to constitute a sufficient basis for identifying and prioritizing sources of all such substances as well as for devising applicable control measures for all Annex C POPs and for evaluating their efficacy. Only in the context of research or other projects it is advisable to analyze emissions of all unintentional POPs listed in Annex C in order to produce useful information for the purpose of deriving emission factors. In addition to emission factors for PCDD/PCDF, the Toolkit also contains emission factors for other POPs when such information is available. Typically, emission factors are provided for the five release vectors, i.e., air (EF ), water (EF ), land (EF ), product (EF ), and residue (EF ). Air Water Land Product Residue 1.2 Purpose The purpose of the “Toolkit for Identification and Quantification of Releases of Dioxins, Furans, and Other Unintentional POPs” is to support Parties in preparing PCDD/PCDF inventories2 that are consistent in format and content, ensuring that it is possible to compare results, identify priorities, mark progress and follow changes over time at the country level, and at the regional and global levels. Towards this end, the Toolkit provides the following “tools”: • A simple but comprehensive procedure for identifying sources of PCDD/PCDF, including but not limited to the source categories listed in Annex C, Parts II and III; • Guidance on gathering basic information on the design, operation and/or expected performance of sources that supports their classification and the assignment of appropriate default emission factors; • Default emission factors – values for the quantity of PCDD/PCDF, expressed as TEQ, released to each vector per unit of activity (e.g., µg TEQ per ton of material produced, per ton of fuel burned, etc.) that have been assigned for each class within the source categories. For the other unintentional POPs, mass concentrations will be assigned as appropriate; • Guidance on acquiring data and related information to estimate national values for annual activity rates for source categories and/or classes",

Countries can also insert new source categories or classes by adding extra lines into the worksheet to better reflect national circumstances. 1.3 Structure and Use of the Toolkit The Toolkit is divided into three parts: Part I contains four chapters providing general guidance for inventory development, Part II contains default emission factors for nine of the ten source groups, and Part III provides complementary information, including 53 annexes and 11 example inventories. Part I Chapter 1‐ Introduction and Overview summarizes the obligations of Parties under Article 5 and Annex C of the Stockholm Convention, describes the purpose and structure of the Toolkit and the chemicals listed in Annex C, including a brief overview of their formation and sources. Chapter 2‐ Identification of PCDD/PCDF Sources and Estimation of Releases addresses the identification of sources and provides general guidance on gathering information that will allow for 1) sources to be identified and catalogued according to the source category and class to facilitate the selection of the most appropriate default emission factors, and 2) guidance to determine activity rates for each of the classes within each source category. Chapter 3‐ Reporting of releases explains how to undertake inventory updates and revisions as well as projections of future releases. Finally, the reporting format under Article 15 of the Convention is described. Chapter 4‐ Data quality provides information on the inventory data quality criteria along with guidance on possible quality assurance and quality control measures and a simple approach to characterize the quality of the inventory results. Part II 1 – Waste Incineration addresses seven source categories of waste incinerators, the classes within each category and the default emission factors for each class. 2 – Ferrous and Non‐Ferrous Metal Production addresses twelve source categories for the production of metals and metal alloys including recycling operations, the classes within each category and the default emission factors for each class. 3 – Heat and Power Generation addresses five source categories of large and small installations using fossil fuels, biomass or gas, the classes within each category and the default emission factors for each class. 4 – Production of Mineral Products addresses seven source categories of processes to manufacture mineral products, the classes within each category and the default emission factors for each class. 5 – Transport addresses four source",

Part III The following annexes provide complementary information: Annex 1 ‐ Table of TEFs Annex 2 ‐ Guidance on identifying sources of PCDD/PCDF Annex 3 ‐ Questionnaires Annex 4 ‐ Compilation of all emission factors Annex 5 ‐ Reporting of releases Annex 6 ‐ Usage of units in air emissions Annex 7 ‐ Per capita/GDP emissions Annex 8 ‐ Data quality Annexes 9 to 53 provide complementary information to source groups 1‐10 and the source categories included in the respective groups. Eleven example inventories are also included in Part III to illustrate the process of update and revision of inventories, as well as specific examples of inventories for source groups 1‐10. The Toolkit (current version updating and amending edition 2, which was published in 2005) is presented in an electronic version (web‐based and CD‐ROM). The electronic version of the Toolkit has been developed to increase the availability, portability and storage of the information. It delivers the Toolkit’s content in an interactive and dynamic manner. The information is organized in a user‐friendly multi‐layer structure according to the level of complexity, where information elements are arranged according to the relevance for the inventory process: 18",

Among other features, the web‐based tool also offers access to interactive features including a search tool and access to Excel files for calculating releases. The user is therefore given flexibility in accessing the content of the Toolkit to meet specific information requirements. 1.4 POPs Releases from Sources The Toolkit has been assembled for the purpose of assisting each country in identifying and quantifying sources of unintentional POPs that are located within the country’s borders and estimating releases from those sources. Sources of POPs releases are of four general types, three of which are active, ongoing processes, and one is a legacy of historic activities: • Chemical production processes, e.g., facilities or production units that produce chlorinated phenols or in which certain other chlorinated chemicals are manufactured, or that produce pulp and paper using elemental chlorine for chemical bleaching; • Thermal and combustion processes, e.g., waste incineration, combustion of solid and liquid fuels, or production of metals in thermal processes; • Biogenic processes in which PCDD/PCDF may be formed from precursors – manufactured chemicals such as pentachlorophenol that are structurally closely related precursors of PCDD/PCDF. • Reservoir sources such as historic dumps containing PCDD/PCDF and other POPs‐contaminated wastes, and soils and sediments in which POPs have accumulated over time. The Toolkit presents information on each of the unintentional POPs source categories listed in Annex C, some additional source categories, and a strategy for identifying new source categories. It describes a step‐by‐step process to estimate PCDD/PCDF releases from each source category to the following environmental media: • Air, • Water (surface and ground water, including marine and estuarine water), and • Land (surface soils), and to these process outputs: 19",

Combustion Processes PCDD/PCDF and other unintentional POPs can be formed in combustion processes when their component elements – carbon, oxygen, hydrogen, and chlorine – are present and combustion temperatures range between 200°C and 900°C (De Fre and Rymen 1989). Two primary mechanisms for PCDD/PCDF formation during combustion have been proposed: • De novo formation, in which non‐extractable carbon‐based structures that fundamentally differ from the PCDD/PCDF undergo transformations and reactions to form PCDD/PCDF; and • Precursor formation/reactions in which hydrocarbon fragments undergo cyclization or incomplete oxidation to form chemicals that share structural similarities with PCDD/PCDF and that undergo further reactions to finally form PCDD/PCDF. PCDD/PCDF formation via these mechanisms can take place homogeneously (molecules react entirely in the gas phase or in the solid phase) or heterogeneously (the reactions take place between gas phase molecules and surfaces). PCDD/PCDF can also be destroyed during combustion when temperatures are sufficiently high, residence times are adequate and mixing in the combustion zone is sufficiently thorough.3 However, combustion gases must also be rapidly cooled in the post‐combustion zone in order to minimize the formation of new PCDD/PCDF in this phase. Variables known to influence PCDD/PCDF formation in combustion processes include the following: • Technology: Poor combustion, poor mixing in the combustion chamber, poorly designed and managed post‐combustion chambers, and inadequate air pollution control devices are associated with increased PCDD/PCDF formation. • Temperature: Formation has been reported in post‐combustion zones and air pollution control devices at temperatures ranging from 200°C to 650°C, with the greatest formation occurring between 200°C and 450°C and peaking at about 300°C; • Metals: Formation is catalyzed by metals including copper, iron, zinc, aluminum, chromium, and manganese; • Sulphur and nitrogen: Chemicals containing sulphur and nitrogen have the potential to inhibit the formation of PCDD/PCDF in",

Whether chlorine is present as organic, inorganic or elemental in the materials combusted is relatively negligible. However, its presence in fly ash or in its elemental form in the gas phase may be especially important. Other variables and combinations of conditions also affect PCDD/PCDF formation. For example, while simulating the burning of household waste in a metal barrel inside a burn hut, Gullet et al. (1999) reported greater PCDD/PCDF formation with 1) increased chlorine in the waste, independent of the original form of the chlorine – organic or inorganic; 2) higher humidity; 3) increased waste load; and 4) higher levels of catalytic metals. Industrial­Chemical Processes As with combustion processes, carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, and chlorine must also be present for PCDD/PCDF to form in industrial‐chemical processes. In chemical manufacturing processes, PCDD/PCDF formation may be favored if one or more of the following conditions apply (NATO/CCMS 1992, Hutzinger and Fiedler 1988): • Elevated temperatures (>150°C); • Alkaline conditions (especially during purification); • Metal catalysis; • Ultraviolet radiation or substances that generate radicals. Among chlorine‐containing chemicals, the following groups have been associated with the formation of PCDD/PCDF as byproducts during their production: • Chlorinated phenols and their derivatives, • Chlorinated aromatics and their derivatives, • Chlorinated aliphatic chemicals, • Chlorinated catalysts and inorganic chemicals. PCDD/PCDF can be also formed as byproducts of some chemicals that do not contain chlorine when some form of chlorine is present or used during their production. Application of Toxic Equivalents (TEQ) Taken as a whole, PCDD and PCDF are a group of 210 tricyclic, chlorine‐containing aromatic chemicals; there are 75 congeners of PCDD and 135 congeners of PCDF possible. PCDD and PCDF typically occur as mixtures. The most toxic compounds have chlorines in the 2, 3, 7 and 8 positions; they have been assigned a toxicity equivalency factor (TEF) based on the relative potency of each congener in comparison to the most toxic congener, 2,",

In total, there are 17 congeners in which chlorine atoms occur at the 2, 3, 7, and 8 positions. Mixtures of these congeners are often evaluated and reported as a single number called toxic equivalent (TEQ). To determine the TEQ of a mixture, the mass concentration of each congener is analytically determined, multiplied with the assigned TEF, and the products summed.

Subsequent revisions of TEFs have been coordinated by the World Health Organization (WHO) in 1997 and 2005. These revisions also included 12 dioxin‐like polychlorinated biphenyls (dl‐PCB). For PCB, the compounds having the highest toxicity are those in which the molecule can assume a planar configuration, analogous to that of PCDD/PCDF. To estimate PCDD/PCDF releases in inventories, the Convention requires that the most advanced TEFs are used. These are, at present, the WHO‐TEFs established by a WHO/IPCS expert meeting in 2005 (van den Berg et al. 2006) (see Annex 1). However, these have not yet been recognized or adopted by the Conference of the Parties. For the purpose of the Toolkit and its “order‐of‐magnitude” estimates of emission factors, the differences between the WHO‐TEFs (either from 1998 or 2005) and the international TEFs (I‐TEFs) previously established by the Committee on the Challenges of Modern Society of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization in 1988 are negligible. Therefore, the TEF‐scheme accompanying the emission factors is not specified in the Toolkit. When reference is made to measured values, the TEF scheme used should be included. 1.5 Limitations An inventory can provide valuable information on the magnitude of releases to each environmental medium and in products and residues. It can highlight sources for possible impacts but it cannot provide an accurate guide to the relative impact of these releases on human or ecosystem exposure since the fate of PCDD/PCDF varies considerably from one release source to another. The main purpose is to identify sources of unintentional POPs, prioritize them and undertake measures to prevent the formation and reduce or eliminate releases of unintentional POPs. Furthermore, measures taken to address PCDD/PCDF releases are equally suitable for other unintentional POPs. The default emission factors presented in the Toolkit are best estimates derived from experimental results at well‐documented sources (i.e., taking into account technology, process characteristics and operating practices) or otherwise based on expert judgment. The results obtained for processes with similar characteristics are then aggregated into one emission factor representing \"order of magnitude\" release estimates, which do not describe accurately PCDD/PCDF",

The additional source will be inserted into the national inventory by adding extra lines into the respective source group (in the EXCEL spreadsheet). Such additions should be highlighted accordingly.5 Sources not listed in the Toolkit To identify PCDD/PCDF sources not currently listed in the Toolkit, it is necessary to determine whether chlorine (in elemental, organic or inorganic forms) is or was present in the processes or activities of interest. PCDD/PCDF formation is influenced by many factors. However, when chlorine is not present, PCDD/PCDF formation cannot occur; when chlorine is present, even as a trace element, PCDD/PCDF formation may occur. When Parties have identified processes or activities that are potential PCDD/PCDF sources due to the presence or use of chlorine in some form, those potential sources should be thoroughly evaluated. Evaluations can begin by investigating existing inventories, the scientific literature, government reports, etc., to determine if the processes of interest or very similar processes have already been reported to release PCDD/PCDF. Additional guidance, including lists of processes and activities for which evidence of PCDD/PCDF formation and/or release exists but which are not addressed elsewhere in the Toolkit, is given in Annex 2. 2.2 Emission Factors For each source category and/or source, it is necessary to obtain basic information about the design, operation, and other related factors that can substantially influence the magnitude of PCDD/PCDF releases. Based on this information, each source will be classified and placed in one of the several classes to which default emission factors are assigned. Example questionnaires provided in Annex 3 may be useful in obtaining the information needed to classify source categories and so select appropriate emission factors. More specific suggestions on the information needed and potential avenues for obtaining such information for a source category may be found in Part II, in the chapters concerning source groups 1 through 10. The default emission factors presented in the Toolkit are drawn from a variety of data sources, ranging from laboratory experiments, peer reviewed literature, dedicated experimental projects, to governmental or institutional reports.",

For the purpose of defining a default emission factor, results/processes with similar characteristics are aggregated into one emission factor. As such, the Toolkit’s default emission factors are approximations intended to represent order of magnitude release estimates. They are suitable to derive national release inventories, set priorities, develop action plans and evaluate their efficacy; however, they should not be taken as accurately describing releases from individual plants/facilities. The Toolkit methodology is designed so that both country‐derived emission factors and the default emission factors presented in the Toolkit can be used. Default emission factors are recommended to be used for comparison or in cases where country‐specific emission factors are not available. 2.3 Activity Rates Activity rates are values in unit per year of product manufactured ( e.g., steel, sinter, cement, pulp, compost, etc.) or feed material processed (e.g., municipal waste, hazardous waste, coal, diesel fuel, bodies cremated, etc.), or annual quantities of material released (e.g., m³ of flue gas, liters of wastewater, kilograms or tons of sludge generated, etc.). Values for activity rates may be found in centralized statistical information assembled by state, provincial, national or international agencies, and they may be obtained from trade associations and owner/operators of facilities. Potential sources of information on activity rates include the following: • National statistics; • National energy balance; • Regional economic activity records including national production and import/export data; • International statistics such as EUROSTAT, OECD, FAO, World Bank etc. • Local operating and permitting records of industrial facilities; • Industry association data; • Historical production and industry data; • Other release inventories such as the inventory of criteria pollutants and or greenhouse gases; • Questionnaires; • Pollution Release and Transfer Registers (PRTRs). When the activity rate for an industrial source category is not available but the nameplate capacity is known, an activity rate can be estimated by multiplying capacity by the domestic capacity utilization factor (CUF). If no domestic CUF is available, a regional or global CUF may be used and, if neither regional nor global CUF is available, the Toolkit Expert Group may provide an appropriate value.

      "text": "Toolkit for Identification and Quantification of Releases of Dioxins, Furans and Other Unintentional POPs January 2013 2.4 Release Estimates Once PCDD/PCDF sources are identified and classified, emission factors selected and national or regional activity rates determined, the estimation of the total annual releases by source group, source category and class is relatively simple and straightforward. For a source class, PCDD/PCDF releases per year are calculated according to the equation below. The activity rate is multiplied by each of the five emission factors and the sum of the five resulting values represents the quantity of PCDD/PCDF released annually from the source class. PCDD/PCDF released, grams TEQ/year = Activity Rate x Emission Factor Air + Activity Rate x Emission Factor Water + Activity Rate x Emission Factor Land + Activity Rate x Emission Factor Product + Activity Rate x Emission Factor Residue For a source category, the annual PCDD/PCDF release is calculated as the sum of the total annual releases for each class within the category. For each source group, the annual PCDD/PCDF release is the sum of the annual releases calculated for each source category in the source group. For a country or region, the total annual PCDD/PCDF release is the sum of the annual releases from all source groups. The spreadsheet will be used to determine annual releases according to source groups and the year of reporting. 2.5 Compilation of PCDD/PCDF Inventory The Toolkit simplifies and expedites the calculations described above by providing an Excel spreadsheet that includes a list of the source categories addressed in the Toolkit, along with their associated classes and accompanying default emission factors. Once the activity rates for all classes within the source categories that have been determined to be present within a country or region are entered into the spreadsheet, annual PCDD/PCDF releases are automatically calculated for each source category. A summarizing worksheet provides an overview of all releases according to vectors (air, water, land, product, residue) and source groups. Newly identified sources can also be included in the spreadsheet, along with their associated emission factors and activity rates. Their releases are also automatically calculated and included in the final results. If desired, a country can replace the Toolkit’s default emission factors with their own emission factors that have been otherwise derived. These and other issues related to the preparation of inventories and reporting of releases are discussed in greater detail in Chapter 3 Reporting of Releases. 27",

These source categories are also among those considered in the Toolkit, where they are placed into ten source groups to facilitate the development of national release inventories and reporting of POPs releases. The standard format to report PCDD/PCDF releases through national reports under Article 15 is included in Annex 5, Table III.5.1. Some countries also report POPs releases to air and a number of other pollutants under the UNECE Convention on Long‐Range Transboundary Air Pollution (CLRTAP). For these countries, a brief explanation of source categorization under CLRTAP, including a list of source categories under the Stockholm Convention and their equivalent designations under CLRTAP, is presented in Annex 5, Table III.5.2. Parties are encouraged to report releases of unintentional POPs in national reports submitted pursuant to Article 15 of the Convention, according to the source categories listed in Annex C of the Convention, grouped into the source groups specified in the Toolkit. By complying with this approach, Parties will ensure that the following conditions are met: • Estimates of unintentional POPs releases are readily comparable; • Regional and global release summaries can be easily prepared; and • Time trends can be readily elaborated for the purpose of effectiveness evaluation under Article 16 of the Convention. 3.2 Baseline Release Estimates, Updating, Revisions, and Projections Article 5, paragraph (a) (i) of the Stockholm Convention requires that Parties evaluate current and projected releases, including the development and maintenance of source inventories and release estimates of chemicals listed in Annex C, Part I, taking into consideration the source categories identified in Annex C, Part II and III, of the Convention. In practice, this means that Parties must prepare their initial release estimates and update these estimates at regular intervals (e.g. every five years). Parties may also find it necessary to revise their initial and subsequent estimates in order to establish and maintain the consistency necessary for discerning meaningful trends in releases over time. The baseline release estimate is the first inventory of sources and releases of Annex C POPs elaborated by a Party, usually as part of the National Implementation Plan developed under Article 7.

      "text": "Toolkit for Identification and Quantification of Releases of Dioxins, Furans and Other Unintentional POPs January 2013 As schematized in Figure I.3.1, updating of the inventory begins with an examination of the previous/baseline inventory to identify the approach used, including: • The classification of sources and emission factors used • Information sources based on which activity rates were estimated • Assumptions and expert judgment applied to fill the gaps In a second step, the developer of the inventory should review changes in data since the baseline inventory, in particular by checking for factors that may influence changes in releases over time. These include: economic and/or demographic growth, changes in technologies in particular through phasing in BAT and BEP, building, reconstruction or close down of production facilities, substitution of fuels, introduction of abatement techniques, identification of new sources, and others. It is also important to check whether new or revised emission factors have become available or new source categories or classes have been included in the Toolkit. Once these data and information are collected, the developer of the inventory will proceed with the reclassification of sources to reflect the current situation in the particular reference year and with the establishment of activity rates for the reference year. Once the information is assessed and the inventory is updated to reflect economic, demographic and technical changes, the need to revise the previous inventories, including the baseline, may arise. Revising previous inventories so that new or revised emission factors and new source categories and classes are incorporated is especially important. Besides such changes in the Toolkit methodology, some specific national factors may also trigger the need for revision. These are usually related to the availability at the country level of new or corrected information/knowledge, e.g. correction of past activity estimates or the discovery of sources that existed in the past but were not considered in previous inventories due to lack of adequate information at that time. The revision of the previous inventories aims to correct the estimates therein, by including missing information, filling gaps, using the same set of emission factors, applying the same assumptions, expert judgment as in the updated inventory. Only after this stage, the developer of the inventory will be able to calculate updated releases and establish consistent trends in releases over time. If sources are reclassified and/or emission factors have been revised, new factors must be assigned accordingly; if the source classification has not changed, nor the emission factors, the same factors are applied; releases are finally estimated by multiplying the emission factors with the corresponding activity rates.

Otherwise it would not be possible to compare data from the different reference years and establish consistent trends over time. Projections of future release estimates may be elaborated by Parties using the same methodology, by considering: • Appropriate emission factors based on planned or expected changes in technologies, raw materials, fuels, abatement techniques or other key parameters which could influence release estimates (e.g. triggered by the action plan developed under Article 5 of the Convention). • Projections of future activity rates for certain source categories based on e.g. ‐ expected socio‐ economic development, production plans for a particular source category or source group, etc. The example inventory 1 shows an illustration of the inventories’ update and revision process. 30",

Reliable inventories entail coherent application of internationally acknowledged methodologies such as the Toolkit and the use of best available national information. To achieve consistency over time, the same approach should be used over time to establish consistent time trends. To ensure comparability between countries, all countries should report according to the same source groups and source categorization. For transparent estimates, the approach, methodology, information, and assumptions used should be clearly described, documented and archived to facilitate inventory updates in the future. For complete release inventories, all relevant source categories, all sources within those categories and all relevant release vectors have to be considered in the whole country. The inventory should also include information on source categories that do not exist or are not operational in the country during the reference year. 4.1 Quality Assurance and Quality Control (QA/QC) The following quality assurance and quality control measures (QA/QC) should be applied to ensure that the source inventory and release estimates meet the quality criteria described above: Activity Rates • Align the unit of the activity rate with the unit of the emission factor. • Pay attention to orders of magnitude while recalculating the activity rates and applying the emission factors. • Explain clearly and completely all assumptions made in filling gaps in activity rates (see also “completeness”). • Explain clearly and completely the process of classification of sources and the way activity rates were derived. Emission Factors • The Toolkit expert group is mandated to evaluate all emission factors that are or will be included in the Toolkit to determine that they are scientifically sound. • National emission factors should only be derived from measured data of adequate quality e.g. the application of standard sampling and analytical methods; proven laboratory experience and good documentation are pre‐requisites of high quality data. 32",

Completeness of Data • Whenever practical and appropriate, individual plant questionnaires may be used to gather information for large point sources6. • Questionnaires provide useful information for the classification of plants and selection of emission factors. Since the return rate of the questionnaires is likely to be low, incomplete information‐data gaps‐ will need to be covered by making assumptions about certain sources, where no specific information can be collected. Approaches will vary, but all assumptions should be clearly described in order to facilitate inventory updates in the following years or revisions in light of improved information. • To determine complete activity rates, a combination of questionnaires (for large point sources) and national statistics should be used. • When reporting the inventory results, it should be distinguished between “not applicable” e.g. the source category does not exist or is not operational in the country, and “not estimated” e.g. the source category is relevant but there was no sufficient information to estimate the releases. Additional Considerations for Assessment of Inventory Results • Compare national inventory results with results from other countries (see Annex 7). • Compare national inventory results across different time periods: differences have to be justified, documented and logically explainable. 4.2 Data quality Possibilities of indicating the confidence in the data used to generate emissions estimates may be as follows: • Reporting of ranges (gives a good indication of confidence in data, however it may create problems while summarizing releases from more countries, therefore suitable only for reporting at the national level); • Simple qualifiers, i.e., data quality codes “high”, “medium”, “low” as outlined in Annex 8. 6 Large point sources include major industrial emitters, and the collection of information on their activity rates should be given priority. Definition of the large point sources as described for different industrial sectors in Annex 1 of the Directive 2008/1/EC on Integrated Pollution Prevention and Control (IPPC) may be used for orientation. As an example, emission from the following large point sources are regulated by the IPPC directive: • combustion installations with a rated thermal input exceeding 50 MW; • installations for the production of iron or steel with a capacity exceeding 2,5 tons per hour; • installations",

Emission factors for certain other unintentional POPs sources are presented in Part III of the Toolkit. The source categories are grouped into 10 source groups. Neither the sequence of the groups, nor the sequence of the source categories within the groups implies any ranking of the importance of each group within a country’s unintentional POPs inventory. The chapters on default emission factors begin with a brief description of the source group’s characteristics followed by an overview of relevant source categories, including major unintentional POPs release routes. Reference is made to the Stockholm Convention and information on each source category’s relevance to Article 5, Annex C is provided. A series of example inventories have also been compiled to provide specific examples of inventories of sources and releases of unintentional POPs. The example inventories were developed to illustrate the inventory process for each of the ten source groups covered by the Toolkit. Emission factors are provided for five release vectors, i.e., air, water, land, product, residue. Individual source categories included in one source group are addressed by the following sub‐ chapters: • Brief description of the source category and potential unintentional POPs releases, linked to the BAT&BEP Guidelines where appropriate; • PCDD/PCDF emission factors for the particular classes along with detailed information needed for the classification of the sources and selection of most appropriate emission factors; • If available, emission factors for other unintentional POPs are provided in Annexes; • Useful guidance facilitating the assessment of relevant activity rates; • Assessment of the level of confidence associated with emission factors by assigning data quality rating; • Detailed information on how the emission factors were derived is also provided in Annexes, along with an overview of all recent revisions performed by the Toolkit expert group; and • Example inventories for every source group are included in Part III. 35\n\n1 ‐ Waste incineration |  | Potential release route |  |  |  | \n---------------------------------------------------------------\nSource categories |  | Air | Water | Land | Product | Residue\na | Municipal solid waste incineration | X | (x) |  |  | X\nb | Hazardous waste incineration | X | (x) |  |  |",

For example, hazardous wastes are commonly generated during the manufacture of chemicals, including commercial chemicals, pharmaceuticals, pesticides, etc. In general, all materials that require special precautions and restrictions during handling and use and any consumer goods that are labeled as hazardous and have entered the waste stream are considered hazardous waste. These include solvents and other volatile hydrocarbons, paints and dyes, chemicals including pesticides and other halogenated chemicals, pharmaceutical products, batteries, fuels, oils and other lubricants, as well as goods containing heavy metals. Also, all materials contaminated with these materials such as soaked rags or paper, treated wood, production residues, etc., must be considered hazardous waste. The term “hazardous waste” as used in the Toolkit does not include medical waste since hazardous and medical wastes have different origins and the technologies for their treatment are different (see source category 1c Medical Waste Incinerators).

A detailed discussion of hazardous waste incineration technologies can be found in the BAT&BEP Guidelines. Co‐combustion in cement kilns is addressed in Group 4 – Mineral Products. Emission Factors PCDD/PCDF emission factors for four classes of HW incinerators are listed in Table II.1.4. Detailed information on the derivation of these emission factors can be found in Annex 10. Guidance for Classification of Sources For the purpose of selecting emission factors, four broadly defined classes of HW incinerators are defined as follows: Class 1 includes very small (< 500 kg/h) and simple furnaces operated in a batch‐fed mode without any APC system for stack gases, e.g., muffle ovens, with flue gas volume flow rate of about 17,500 Nm³/t of hazardous waste Class 2 includes HW incinerators with controlled combustion and minimal APC systems, with flue gas volume flow rate to 15,000 Nm³/t of hazardous waste. Class 3 incinerators have further improved combustion efficiencies and more efficient systems resulting in PCDD/PCDF concentrations of about 1 ng TEQ/Nm³ (at 11% O ). Also, the specific flue gas 2 volume flow rate is reduced to 10,000 Nm³/t HW. Class 4 is limited to highly sophisticated hazardous waste incineration plants that are capable of complying with a regulatory value of 0.1 ng TEQ/Nm³ (at 11% O ), such as legislated in the in 2 European Union. Class 4 represents the current state‐of‐the‐art in HW incineration and APC technology with stack gas flow rates of some 7,500 Nm³/t HW.

In addition, data are lacking for bottom ash concentrations. The emission factors are thus assigned a low confidence level. 1c Medical Waste Incinerators Medical waste (MW) is considered to be every waste generated from medical activities regardless if these activities take place in a hospital or are performed by a medical doctor, dentist or any other healthcare facility or provider. In many cases, waste generated during these activities contains infectious materials, human secretions, blood, pharmaceuticals and packaging materials and/or tools used during or for the medical treatment of people or animals. To destroy viruses, bacteria, and pathogens this waste is often thermally treated (by incineration or pyrolysis). Further, due to its origin and its composition, medical waste can contain toxic chemicals, e.g., heavy metals or precursors, high concentrations of organic (polyvinyl chloride and certain pharmaceuticals) and inorganic (saline solution and body fluids) chlorine that may alter combustion characteristics, and absent proper technology may enhance PCDD/PCDF formation. MW is a waste that requires special surveillance and incineration of all wastes generated within a hospital has been regarded as an efficient way to dispose of these wastes. However, it has also been shown that incineration of medical waste in small and poorly controlled incinerators is a major source of PCDD/PCDF. Typically, medical waste is incinerated locally at the hospital or any other medical facility in small furnaces in a batch‐type mode. In many cases, larger and centralized medical waste incineration facilities are operated only for eight hours a day and five days a week. Large and continuously operated medical waste incinerators are rare and mostly found in developed regions and countries. Also, waste heat recovery boilers are rare. For a more detailed discussion of medical waste incinerators refer to the BAT&BEP Guidelines.

Typical separation mechanisms include screening, sifting, and fractionation processes, in which weight differences between the materials or the magnetic properties of ferrous metals allow the shredder aggregate to be fractionated into ferrous metals, non‐ferrous metals, glass, other heavy inerts, and light‐weight fractions. In some cases the light fraction has little use and may be combusted for disposal. Emission Factors PCDD/PCDF emission factors for three classes of LFSW incinerators are listed in Table II.1.6. Detailed information on how these emission factors have been derived can be found in Annex 12. Guidance for Classification of Sources For selection of the most appropriate emission factors, the range of LFSW incineration technologies is divided into three classes: Class 1 includes very simple stationary grate furnaces with no combustion controls and no APC equipment. Batch type furnaces without any APC also fall into class 1. Class 2 includes all other furnaces with some kind of combustion control technology such as under and/or over fire air, stoker controls, fluidized beds, etc. including the facilities with some kind of APC system such as an ESP, baghouse or wet scrubber for dust removal. Class 2 also applies to LFSW incinerators with controlled combustion and adequate APC equipment, which, however, are still operated in a batch type mode. Class 3 includes highly sophisticated incineration plants that are capable of achieving a regulatory value for air emissions equivalent to 0.1 ng TEQ/Nm³ (at 11% O ). 2 Table II.1.6 PCDD/PCDF emission factors for source category 1d Light‐Fraction Shredder Waste Incinerators Emission Factors (µg TEQ/t 1d Light‐Fraction Shredder Waste Incinerators LFSW incinerated) Classification Air Residue 1 Uncontrolled batch type combustion, no",

No accurate data are available for class 1, in which case the emission factor is assigned a low confidence level. 1e Sewage Sludge Incinerators Sewage sludge is produced from all wastewater treatment processes regardless of the wastewater’s origin (e.g., wastewater from municipal, agricultural or industrial activities). When untreated, such wastewater always contains solids, which are normally removed as sludge during the treatment process. Since PCDD/PCDF are almost insoluble in water, the majority of the PCDD/PCDD adsorb to the solids present in the wastewater. These solids along with the adsorbed PCDD/PCDF can be removed by filtration or flocculation, so that the PCDD/PCDF are collected in the wastewater treatment sludge. This sludge can be disposed of in a variety of ways, including combustion in dedicated incinerators. A detailed discussion of sewage sludge incineration technologies is presented in the BAT&BEP Guidelines. Disposal of sewage sludge in landfills is addressed in Group 9 – Disposal and Landfill; combustion with energy recovery, in Group 7 – Production and Use of Chemicals and Consumer Goods; co‐combustion in boilers and fossil fuel power plants, in Group 3 – Power Generation and Heating; and co‐ combustion in cement kilns, in Group 4 – Mineral Products.

The data presented in these different studies are in agreement, and the emission factors are assigned a medium confidence level. 1g Destruction of Animal Carcasses Animal carcasses accumulate in quantities sufficient to require large‐scale disposal as a result of disease outbreaks in beef and dairy herds, intensive poultry‐ and hog‐raising facilities, veterinary hospitals and practices, etc. The incineration of animal carcasses to reduce public exposure to zoonotic disease is often carried out in simple, low technology, poorly controlled furnaces. As a result, incomplete combustion is the norm rather than the exception. Thus, it is virtually impossible to describe a typical animal carcass‐burning furnace. These furnaces are often not designed to guarantee well‐controlled combustion conditions nor a high removal efficiency of particulate matter to reduce PCDD/PCDF air emissions. Destruction of animal carcasses via open burning is addressed in Group 6 – Open Burning Processes. Emission Factors PCDD/PCDF emission factors for three classes of animal carcass incinerators are listed in Table II.1.9.

Typically the specific waste gas flow is between 1,500 and 2,500 Nm³/t of sinter (BREF 2012). Waste gases are usually treated by dust removal in a cyclone, electrostatic precipitator, wet scrubber or fabric filter. In plants where high PCDD/PCDF emissions have been identified, high performance scrubbing systems may be installed to reduce emissions, coupled with measures to reduce gas flows. Extensive research into formation of PCDD/PCDF in the sintering process has shown that they are formed within the sinter bed itself, probably just ahead of the flame front as hot gases are drawn through the bed. It has also been shown that de novo formation of PCDD/PCDF in the gas collectors from reactive fine dust particles is responsible for approximately 10% of the total PCDD/PCDF and that primary measures to prevent PCDD/PCDF formation should be taken in the sinter bed. Besides input‐related measures, disruptions to flame front propagation, i.e. non‐steady state operations, result in higher PCDD/PCDF emissions (Nordsieck et al. 2001). Thus, operating the sintering process as consistent as possible in terms of strand speed, bed composition, bed height, use of additives, and keeping the strand, ductwork and ESP air tight to minimize, as far as possible, the amount of air ingress in the operation will result in less PCDD/PCDF formation. Emission Factors PCDD/PCDF emission factors for three source classes are listed in Table II.2.3. Revised or newly added emission factors are highlighted in red. Emission factors for other unintentional POPs are listed in Annex 16. Detailed information on how default emission factors have been derived can also be found in Annex 16.

When analyzing the copper production sector for PCDD/PCDF releases, it is important to differentiate between primary and secondary production. Primary copper Primary copper may be produced by two different technologies depending on the type of minerals treated, either oxides or sulfides, and from primary concentrates and other materials either by pyrometallurgical or hydrometallurgical routes (BREF 2009). Hydrometallurgical methods are applied to treat oxidized minerals, i.e. leaching, solvent extraction, and electrowinning. All these processes are operated at temperatures below 50°C. It is not expected that formation of PCDD/PCDF will occur. Typically, sulfurized minerals are treated by the pyrometallurgical route. Sulphidic minerals are first treated in a concentration plant, operated at room temperature, and then the concentrates are pyrometallurgically refined in primary copper smelters. The concentrates to be smelted consist basically of copper and iron sulfides and are low in chlorine (ppm). The stages involved are roasting, smelting, converting, refining, and electrorefining. The smelting process is performed in an oxidizing atmosphere at temperatures between 1,200°C and 1,300°C. Further process details are described in the BAT&BEP Guidelines. Secondary copper Secondary copper is produced by pyrometallurgical processes and is obtained from scrap or other copper‐bearing residues such as slags and ashes",

Magnesium can also be recovered and produced from a variety of magnesium‐containing secondary raw materials. The electrolysis process is more widely used. This process seems to be of most interest from the point of view of PCDD/PCDF formation and release. Secondary magnesium production is not addressed in this section. In the thermal reduction process, calcined dolomite is reacted with ferro‐silicon sometimes together with aluminum in a furnace or retort vessel. The calcination process takes place by decarbonization and dehydration of dolomite limestone. For the calcination process of dolomite, often a rotate or vertical furnace is used.

The exact processes used and the propensity to form PCDD/PCDF are complex and not studied in detail. It is important not to miss potentially significant PCDD/PCDF sources simply because data are insufficient to provide comprehensive emissions factors. Therefore, to provide an initial indication of potential releases, it is suggested that processes in non‐ferrous metal production are examined. Releases may occur to air, water, and in residues. When investigating production processes, it is suggested that thermal processes are noted, the type of gas cleaning system applied recorded, and the levels of contamination found in the input materials noted. The use of Cl or hexachloroethane for refining, 2 and the presence of chlorinated compounds in raw materials should also be noted. The Questionnaire provided in the Toolkit will assist in identifying and recording these parameters. In the case of these non‐ferrous metals, a 3‐step approach is proposed: 1. First step: some non‐ferrous metals are produced in conjunction with metals which are assigned to a specific category in the toolkit. In that case, the corresponding emission factors should be considered. For example: • Cadmium may be produced in conjunction with lead or zinc. Emission factors of category 2f (class 4) or category 2g (class 4) should be considered. • Precious metals may be produced in conjunction with copper or lead.

Second step: some non‐ferrous metals are produced in processes similar to other processes which are assigned to a specific category or class in the toolkit. In that case, the corresponding emission factors should be considered. For example, ferro‐alloys are usually produced in electric arc furnaces similar to those used in the iron and steel sector, hence emission factors of category 2c should be considered. Another example are zinc alloys (e.g. zamak) which can be produced similarly to bronze and brass. Therefore, emission factors of category 2h, if appropriate classes apply, can be used as default values. 3. Finally, if a given non‐ferrous metal cannot be considered under the first or the second step, emission factors of category 2j should be used. 64\n\n2j | Other Non‐Ferrous Metal Production | Emission Factors (µg TEQ/t product) |  |  |  | \n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nClassification |  | Air | Water | Land | Product | Residue\n1 | Thermal non‐ferrous metal processes –\ncontaminated scrap, simple or no APCS | 100 | ND | NA | NA | ND\n2 | Thermal non‐ferrous metal processes –\nclean scrap, fabric filters/lime\ninjection/afterburners | 2 | ND | NA | NA | ND\n\n\n2k | Shredders | Emission Factors (µg TEQ/t recovered steel) |  |  |  | \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nClassification |  | Air | Water | Land | Product | Residue\n1 | Metal shredding plants | 0.2 | NA | NA | ND | 5\n\n\n2l | Thermal Wire Reclamation and E‐Waste\nRecycling | Emission Factors (µg TEQ/t material) |  |  |  | \n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nClassification |  | Air | Water | Land | Product | Residue\n1 | Open burning of cable | 12,000 | ND | ND | ND | ND\n",

For all classes, it is assumed that reasonably well‐operated and maintained power steam generators are employed in order to maximize power output. In all cases, air and residue are the only release vectors under consideration. Fossil fuel is burned in a wide array of devices for power generation ranging from small stoker fired furnaces to large and highly sophisticated boiler/burner systems with extensive air pollution control plants at the back end. Coal combustion for power generation takes place in two general types of boilers distinguished by the way the ash is extracted from the system. The so‐called dry bottom boilers use stokers or pulverized coal burners arranged in an opposed wall, which burn coal in a highly efficient manner leaving the majority of the ash as a dry residue at the bottom of the boiler. The so‐called wet bottom boilers use pulverized burners in a cyclone or U‐fired arrangement, which leads to much higher combustion temperatures resulting in the ash melting and collected as a liquid slag at the bottom of the boiler. Typical flue gas cleaning devices for large coal‐fired power plants consist of units for NOx control (e.g. SCR technology), particulate matter control (e.g. electrostatic precipitators) and desulphurization (e.g. lime stone",

Typical flue gas cleaning devices for large coal‐fired power plants consist of units for NOx control (e.g. SCR technology), particulate matter control (e.g. electrostatic precipitators) and desulphurization (e.g. lime stone scrubbing). These devices can reduce PCDD/PCDF emissions as a side effect. Heavy fuel oil is also combusted for power generation purposes. It is usually burned in specially designed burners incorporated in the boiler walls. The formation of PCDD/PCDF is favored during co‐ combustion of liquid or sludge wastes such as waste oil and/or used solvents. Light fuel oil and natural gas are always fired in specially designed burners and are not likely to generate large amounts of PCDD/PCDF since both are highly calorific, clean burning fuels with little or no ash at all. Only if liquid or sludge waste is co‐fired, higher releases of PCDD/PCDF may be formed.

In Estonia, for example, more than 90% of the country’s electricity is generated from shale oil (Schleicher 2004a). In some countries peat is a domestic energy resource and is used for heat and/or power generation, e.g. in Finland or Ireland (McGettigan et al. 2009). Like in all combustion processes, PCDD/PCDF are usually formed after the combustion process is completed and the flue gas cools down. The remaining soot particles and the chlorine contained in the coal recombine in the presence of the metal‐chloride catalysts to form PCDD/PCDF. Releases to water, land and product are normally negligible. Major release routes are to air and residue, especially to fly ash. Releases to water may occur at plants where wet scrubbers are installed, where water is not recirculated within the scrubbers. In such cases, releases to water have to be included. Sludge from such scrubbers, when separated from the effluents, will occur under “Residues”. In the case of wet limestone scrubbing for desulfurization, the resulting gypsum is used in building industries and may be considered as “Product”. In some countries, catalysts are marketed for the combustion of soot and boiler cleaning. These catalysts contain copper salts and lead to a significant increase of PCDD/PCDF formation to air and residues. Measurements from Poland show an increase of emissions in such cases by a factor of 1,000. Emission Factors PCDD/PCDF emission factors for six source classes are listed in Table II.3.3. The emission factors apply to the operation of boilers in general and therefore include the combined heat and power production as well as the production of heat only. Revised or newly added emission factors are highlighted in red. Detailed information on how these emission factors have been derived can be found in Annex 30.

Therefore, national energy statistics and their source category split are essential for source classification. Class 1 For the co‐firing of waste, the allocation to this class depends on the main purpose of the process (here: heat and power generation, not waste incineration). Co‐firing usually occurs with solid fuels (coal, lignite) together with sewage sludge, biomass, organic waste from industry or other waste‐derived fuels. The co‐combustion of different types of gases (e.g. coke oven gas and blast furnace gas) is not considered here. The combustion of sewage sludge together with liquid fuels or natural gas should be allocated to waste incineration. Class 2 The emission factors refer to the combustion of hard coal. In case of information lacking at the national level, this factor may be transferred to lignite fired boilers. Emission factors can be significantly higher in the case of unfavorable combustion conditions (Grochowalski and Konieczynski 2008, see Annex 30).

In most cases, the actual quantity needs to be directly collected from the power plant operators. If no statistical data exist, estimates may be based on a smaller sample at the local scale, with an extrapolation of results to the whole country. Level of confidence The levels of confidence were assigned based on a lack of knowledge of the sources and the variability of the emissions from a given source. The latter is linked to fuel quality and operating conditions. The variability of emissions becomes lower with higher fuel quality (e.g. natural gas compared to co‐firing of waste) and optimized plant operation (e.g. large power plants compared to small boilers). The level of confidence is high for natural gas (due to high range of data from many 71\n\n3a | Fossil Fuel Power Plants | Emission Factors (µg TEQ/TJ fossil fuel burned) | | | | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Classification | | Air | Water | Land | Product | Residue 1 | Fossil fuel/waste co‐fired power boilers | 35* | ND | NA | NA | ND 2 | Coal fired power boilers | 10** | ND | NA | NA | 14 3 | Peat fired power boilers | 17.5 | ND | NA | NA | ND 4 | Heavy fuel fired power boilers | 2.5 | ND | NA | NA | ND 5 | Shale oil fired power boilers | 1.5 | ND | NA | NA | *** 6 | Light fuel oil/natural gas fired power boilers | 0.5 | ND | NA | NA | ND",

The results should be cross‐checked with regard to the consistency of the overall inventory (share of the sector in total emissions; per capita emissions compared to countries with a similar structure). 3b Biomass Power Plants Many countries and regions are heavily dependent on the combustion of biomass for power and heat production. Biomass fuels may include wood including twigs, bark, saw dust, wood shavings, peat, and/or agricultural residue (e.g., straw, citrus pellets, coconut shells, poultry litter, camel excretes, etc.). In most cases, biomass is burned directly and without any addition of fossil fuels in small, continuously operated steam boilers. For the Toolkit, four classes are defined within this category according to the type of biomass used, namely wood‐fired boilers using clean wood or mixed biomass, and other types of herbaceous biomass‐fired boilers, namely straw and other agricultural residues. Agricultural residues like straw or rice husk are an important fuel type in many countries. This herbaceous biomass often has higher chlorine content compared to wood, leading to problems during combustion (e.g. slagging) but also to potentially higher formation of PCDD/PCDF. Therefore emission factors are distinguished from those for wood combustion. For all classes, it is assumed that reasonably well‐operated and maintained power steam generators are employed in order to maximize power output. In all cases, air and residue are the only release vectors. This category does not address firing of contaminated wood waste, which is covered by category 1f Waste Wood and Waste Biomass Incineration. Biomass is burned in a wide array of devices for power generation ranging from small stoker fired furnaces to large and highly sophisticated boiler/burner systems with extensive air pollution control plants at the back end. The various types of biomass furnaces with typical applications and fuels are presented in the BAT&BEP Guidelines. Emission Factors PCDD/PCDF emission factors for four source classes are listed in Table II.3.4. Revised or newly added emission factors are highlighted in red.

In some countries, classifications of wood waste exist which refer to the level of contamination. Here, mixed biomass refers to the category characterizing low contamination. This type of wood waste is frequently used in CHP boilers e.g. in wood industries. Incineration of contaminated wood waste shall be allocated to category 1f (waste wood and waste biomass incineration). Class 2 includes boilers firing log wood, wood chips or pellets as a high quality fuel allowing optimized combustion conditions. Class 3 includes boilers firing straw for heat or power production. Straw‐fired boilers need to be adapted to this fuel with regard to ash properties (slagging) and combustion conditions. 72\n\n3b | Biomass Power Plants | Emission Factors (µg TEQ/TJ biomass burned) |  |  |  | \n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nClassification |  | Air | Water | Land | Product | Residue*\n1 | Mixed biomass fired power boilers | 500 | ND | NA | NA | ND\n2 | Clean wood fired power boilers | 50 | ND | NA | NA | 15\n3 | Straw fired boilers | 50 | ND | NA | NA | 70\n4 | Boilers fired with bagasse, rice husk, etc | 50** | ND | NA | NA | 50\n\n\n3c | Landfill Biogas Combustion | Emission Factors (µg TEQ/TJ gas burned) |  |  |  | \n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nClassification |  | Air | Water | Land | Product | Residue\n1 | Boilers, motors/turbines, flaring | 8 | ND | NA | NA | NA\n\n\n3d | Household Heating and Cooking\nwith Biomass | Emission Factors (µg TEQ/TJ\nbiomass burned) |  |  |  | Concentration\n(ng TEQ/kg ash)\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nClassification |  | Air | Water | Land | Product | Residue\n1 | Contaminated biomass fired stoves | 1,500 | ND | ND | NA | ",

These catalysts contain copper salts and lead to a significant increase of dioxin formation for both release routes air and residues. Measurements from Poland show an increase of emissions in such cases by a factor of 1,000. Emission Factors PCDD/PCDF emission factors for six source classes are listed in Table II.3.7.

Guidance for classification of sources Class 1 applies to domestic stoves firing coal with high chlorine content (chlorine salt content above 0.5% mass). High chlorine salt contents are a specific property of certain domestic coals. Information on properties of coals and briquettes marketed in a country for domestic use needs to be taken into account. Class 2 applies to domestic stoves using mixed solid fuels. In most cases this category applies to the simultaneous or alternating firing of coal and biomass. Nevertheless, co‐firing of waste in residential appliances is an illegal practice in many countries. Class 3 applies to domestic stoves, ovens and boilers firing coal or coal briquettes with low chlorine content. Class 4 applies to domestic stoves, ovens and boilers firing peat. The use of peat as a fuel in the residential sector is closely linked to its local availability. Class 5 applies to domestic stoves, ovens and boilers firing light fuel oil. The use of heavy oil fractions in the residential sector is often banned. Class 6 applies to domestic stoves, ovens and boilers firing natural gas.

Specific investigations may be necessary to quantify domestic peat consumption as it may be produced in an artisanal way. Expert estimates have to be made to quantify emissions from the combustion of mixed solid fuels. Energy statistics do not address the share of co‐firing in total fuel consumption.

Level of confidence In this category, the level of uncertainty is directly linked with the fuel quality. The level of confidence is high in the case of natural gas combustion (class 6). This is due to the use of clean fuel and high stability of the process. Low confidence levels can be attributed to the combustion of mixed solid fuels in particular in the case of co‐firing of waste (classes 1 and 2), due to the low stability of the process and wide range of data.

Raw materials or fuels that contain chlorides may potentially cause the formation of PCDD/PCDF at various steps of the processes, e.g., during the cooling phase of the gases or in the heat zone. Due to the long residence time in kilns and the high temperatures needed for the product, emissions of PCDD/PCDF are generally low in these processes.

There are four main process routes for the manufacture of cement: the dry, semi‐dry, semi‐wet and wet processes. These processes are described in detail in the BAT&BEP Guidance. Modern cement kilns often use the dry process, in which raw mill material may be pre‐heated in a vertically arrayed multi‐cyclone pre‐heater, in which the rising hot gases exiting the kiln contact the downward flowing raw materials. Some dry processes also employ a pre‐calciner stage just before the raw material enters the kiln. The use of the wet process, where the ground meal is mixed with water and fed into the kiln uses about 40% more energy than the dry process.

Levels of PCDD/PCDF and other unintentional POPs in exhaust gases from vehicles depend on many factors including the type of engine, its maintenance condition and age, technologies of emission reduction applied (catalysts), type and quality of fuel, driving conditions, ambient conditions etc. The assessment of the impacts of these factors on releases is very important, especially when considering the growth in the number of cars. For the purpose of developing a PCDD/PCDF emission inventory, a simple methodology can be used, where PCDD/PCDF emission rates are considered as a function of the type of engine and type of fuel. The impact of these two parameters on PCDD/PCDF concentrations in exhaust gases are among the most studied. Thus, Toolkit emission factors are given according to the type of combustion engine, the type of fuel, and the emission reduction technology applied (catalysts). Four source categories are included in this group (see Table II.5.1): 4‐stroke engines (gasoline fueled engines with spark ignition), 2‐stroke engines (gasoline fueled engines with spark ignition), Diesel engines (Diesel fueled engines with compression ignition), and heavy oil fueled engines (mostly turbines). These types of engines are dominant in the transport sector. In addition, other types of engines are also used such as Wankel rotary engines, gas generators etc. These are nevertheless less frequent and may be included into the existing Toolkit categories. The major fuels used in road transportation are gasoline and Diesel. In smaller volumes, other types of fuels such as liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), compressed natural gas (CNG), liquid biofuels (ethanol, methanol, biodiesel) and hydrogen are used. Their market is growing but, so far, no dioxin measurements are available. In order to accommodate releases from these fuels, the following hypotheses are proposed: • For LPG‐fuelled cars: take the emission factor for 4‐stroke engines with catalyst (5a3); • For oil/gas or oil/gasoline mixtures: the emission factor for Diesel should be applied (5c1). As for air transport, the occurrence of PCDD/PCDF has not been reported from aircrafts. Increases in concentrations or changes",

Increases in concentrations or changes in patterns of PCDD/PCDF could not be detected in a biomonitoring program at the Frankfurt International Airport on long‐term exposure of kale at different locations, i.e., along the runway or close to the terminals. Consequently, it was assumed that the combustion of kerosene in aircraft motors is not a source of PCDD/PCDF and this category is not addressed in the Toolkit (Fiedler et al. 2000a, Buckley‐Golder et al. 1999).

These engines follow the thermodynamic combustion cycle invented by Nicolaus Otto, which consists of 4 strokes, namely the intake stroke, the compression stroke, the ignition and combustion stroke, and the exhaust stroke. These four strokes are completed during two full revolutions of the crankshaft. Like all combustion processes, internal combustion engines produce PCDD/PCDF as an unwanted byproduct. Higher emissions have been associated with the use of chlorinated scavengers in leaded gasoline. However, when unleaded gasoline is used and a catalytic converter is installed for the removal of NOx and unburned hydrocarbons, the emissions of PCDD/PCDF are negligible. The only release vector is to air. Other release vectors are not present. Emission Factors PCDD/PCDF emission factors for four source classes are listed in Table II.5.3.

None of these combustion processes and fires occurs under defined or optimized conditions. Aeration occurs by natural ventilation. In the first source category, burning conditions vary from poor to highly efficient depending on the type of fuel, fuel arrangement and the ambient conditions such as humidity, temperature, fuel moisture and wind speed. In the second group, burning conditions are commonly poor due to heterogeneous composition, compacted and poorly mixed fuel materials. Further, moisture and lack of oxygen may contribute to additional complexity. Typically, there is no intervention to select the fuels or to improve the combustion conditions. In certain jurisdictions, some of these processes are not authorized and are therefore un‐documented. Consequently the releases from these processes tend to be underestimated because of difficulties in assessing the overall national activity. Throughout this source group, releases of unintentional POPs with solid residues such as combustion ashes are regarded as releases to land rather than release to residue, since due to the lack of containment, the ashes are disposed on land and are typically not collected for further disposal. Therefore, an EF is provided. Subsequently, to avoid double‐counting, no EF is provided, Land Residue although the release vector is ash.

      "text": "Toolkit for Identification and Quantification of Releases of Dioxins, Furans and Other Unintentional POPs January 2013 6a Biomass Burning This category covers the burning of biomass where it occurs in the open. It includes all fires in natural and managed ecosystems including forests, woodlands, shrublands, grasslands, savannah, plantations, and all fires in agricultural lands. This section does not address any process that converts biomass into another form of energy such as steam, controlled combustion in appliances such as stoves, furnaces and boilers. Such processes are covered in Group 3 ‐ Power Generation and Heating. Fires in natural and managed ecosystems include wildfires regardless of the ignition source and all fires conducted for land management including fuel reduction for wildfire mitigation, biodiversity management, forest slash removal and seed bed preparation following logging operation, and the removal of forest biomass following land clearing for conversion to agriculture and other land uses. Ignition sources include lightning, deliberate arson, accidental ignitions (e.g., burning cigarettes, glass, welders, power transmission lines) and authorized ignitions for management purposes. A broad definition of forest class is applied in the Toolkit. It includes temperate and tropical rainforests; temperate, boreal, and Eucalyptus forests; temperate shrublands; tundra; peatlands; and forest plantations. Savannah woodlands and savannah grasslands are ecosystems comprising open and sparse woodlands dominated by an extensive understory of grasses. The annual climate is a short productive wet season followed by a long drought during which the grasses senesce and the fuels dry. Fire is an essential and integral component of these ecosystems and has been traditionally used by indigenous populations for many millennia to manage animal and plant food sources (Russell‐ Smith et al. 2009a). Fire return interval in these regions is short, typically less than three years (Archibald et al. 2010). Fires in these ecosystems comprise the major proportion of global annual fire affected land area (Gilio et al. 2006). Fires are also commonly used in agriculture. Post‐harvest field burning is practiced to remove residues prior to soil preparation and sowing, to control weeds, and release nutrients for the next crop cycle, however, also negative effects on soil may occur and, ideally, this practice is used judiciously. It is applied extensively, but not exclusively, in cereal production (wheat, rice, maize, and coarse grains) in many regions.",

It is applied extensively, but not exclusively, in cereal production (wheat, rice, maize, and coarse grains) in many regions. Pre‐harvest burning is used in some crops, particularly sugar cane, to remove debris and pests and to facilitate manual and mechanical harvesting. Emission Factors Emission from this source category will vary depending on ambient atmospheric conditions, fuel type and structure, composition, and contamination with PCDD/PCDF precursors. When biomass fuels are wet or compacted, burning efficiency is poor, combustion temperature is low, and consequently, PCDD/PCDF emissions are high. PCDD/PCDF emissions are also assumed to be high when the biomass has been treated with pesticides that act as PCDD/PCDF precursors or as catalysts for PCDD/PCDF formation, in these cases the biomass is said to be “impacted”. At the other extreme, burning of dry, virgin biomass of small size would burn efficiently and have small emission factors. Emission factors for PCDD/PCDF are listed in Table II.6.3, and for dioxin‐like PCB are listed in Table III.45.1 in Annex 45. Detailed information on the derivation of default emission factors can also be found in Annex 45. Revised or newly added PCDD/PCDF emission factors are highlighted in red. 94",

Although little experimental data exist, it is assumed that prior application of chlorinated pesticides to crops would increase PCDD/PCDF formation and release. Other contributing factors include unfavorable burning conditions such as large piles or humid materials. In general, the biomass may be cereal, legume oilseed or fibre crops and can be burned as stubble, cut and left in the field or bundled into piles. This class potentially includes a wide range of fire intensity from relatively cool, low‐intensity fires with mostly smouldering combustion to hot, high intensity, fast‐moving fires with efficient combustion. Class 2 addresses the same type of biomass and geometry of the fuel; however, the fuel and the burning conditions would constitute best environmental practices such as the absence of precursors or other conditions that favor PCDD/PCDF formation. These fires also range from cool to hot fires. Class 3 addresses the pre‐harvest burning of sugarcane in the field. It is assumed that the leaves will be burned off and the stems will remain in the field for harvest either manually or by machine. These fires are usually intense, fast moving and of relatively short duration. Class 4 includes all types of forest fires, including those in which whole trees are burned, canopy fires and forest litter burns. Class 5 addresses fires in savannahs and grasslands. Fires in savannahs frequently consume low shrubs in addition to grass and litter from trees.

Combustible fuel density is determined from measurements of above ground biomass of potential fuel classes and the fraction of this mass that is actually burned. Consequently combustible fuel density varies with vegetation class, fire class and season. A compilation of average fuel densities for most vegetation classes relevant to the Toolkit classes is provided in Table II.6.4.

These sources can be valuable supplements to national statistics and are useful for QA/QC assessment of inventory emission estimates.

In this source category, there is no recovery of the calorific content of the fuel. As with the source classes under category 6a, releases of unintentional POPs in solid residues such as combustion ashes are regarded as releases to land rather than release to residue since the ashes are disposed on land and are typically not collected for further disposal.

Revised or newly added emission factors are highlighted in red. For dioxin‐like PCB, available emission factors are listed in Table III.46.1 in Annex 46. Detailed information on how default emission factors have been derived can also be found in Annex 46, along with detailed guidance on activity rates. Guidance for classification of sources Class 1 refers to spontaneous or intentional fires occurring in a municipal or domestic waste repository. Waste at such sites may often include refuse from offices, small factories or workshops and restaurants. In some cases, these fires have the purpose of reducing the volume of waste in the repository. Typically, the waste will be relatively high in organic carbon. The combustible material will tend to be compacted and moist, and will burn poorly and slowly; hence the higher emission factor than for class 3. Typically, ignition occurs from either sparks occurring at the surface area, from self‐ ignition inside the waste body or intentionally for management reasons. It should be noted that fires of this type are very uncommon in modern engineered landfills, particularly those with compaction, daily soil cover, runoff water recycling or leach",

Class 2 includes accidental fires involving buildings, such as homes and factories. Consequently, emission factors must be given per event and they depend strongly on the materials burned and on the nature of the fire. There is limited information on releases from these fires and a single indicative figure is given to cover all accidental fires excluding fires in vehicles. Chemical fires may lead to very high releases where certain precursor chemicals are involved.

It should be noted that specific incidents may give rise to local contamination and potential “hot spots”. Class 3 includes burning of domestic waste in open piles, pits, barrels, with no pollution controls. The waste is typically characterized by a large fraction of organic/agricultural waste and is loosely arranged (not compacted). Class 4 includes fires that involve cars and other vehicles. Limited data are available for deriving emission factors for such events and vehicles involved can vary considerably so emissions are expected to vary as well. Consequently the emission factors here are for rough estimates only. Class 5 includes open burning of wood and other materials used in construction and remaining after demolition. Such wood may be painted or treated with preservatives and plastics, including PVC, or may be present in the other materials burned.

An alternative method for determining production rates that uses nameplate capacity and Capacity Utilization Factor (CUF) is found in Chapter 2.3. 7a Pulp and Paper Production Feedstocks for pulp production include wood as well as non‐wood materials such as wheat straws, reed, and bamboo. The major types of pulp and paper mills are as follows (EC 2001): • Kraft or sulfate pulp and paper mills account for about 80% of world pulp production; • Sulfite pulp and paper mills account for about 10% of world production; • Mechanical pulp and paper mills; and • Recycled fiber paper mills. Pulp and paper production processes may release PCDD/PCDF to these vectors: • Releases to air from energy generation9; • Releases to water in wastewater treatment effluents; • Releases to residue as wastewater treatment sludge and ashes or smelt; and • Releases to product – pulp and paper. In general terms, the process of making paper and paperboard consists of three steps: pulp making, pulp processing, and paper/paperboard making. A detailed description of the process is available in the BAT&BEP Guidelines. Emission Factors PCDD/PCDF emission factors for on‐site heat/power production are listed in Table II.7.3 and those for other pulp and paper production processes are presented according to the activity type in Tables II.7.4 and II.7.5. Revised or newly added emission factors are highlighted in red. Detailed information on the derivation of emission factors can be found in Annex 47. Guidance for classification of sources On‐site boilers for heat/power generation for the pulp and paper production are classified as follows: Class 1 Recovery boilers fired with black liquor or black liquor/bio‐sludge (for sludge for modern bleaching technology)10; Class 2 Power boilers fired with sludge and biomass/bark; Class 3 Power boilers fired with salt‐laden wood. 9 From lime kilns (see source group 4), smelt dissolving tanks at Kraft mills, and from any on‐site incinerators for disposing of sludge and other wastes not used as fuels for power or auxiliary",

Uses of Cl vary greatly by country and region. In the chlor‐alkali process, Cl and caustic soda 2 2 [sodium hydroxide (NaOH)] are produced in a mass ratio of 1:1.1 by the electrolysis of brine (sodium chloride). Factors that can influence PCDD/PCDF formation and release in the chlor‐alkali process include process design and direct contact of Cl with reactive materials, such as graphite electrodes 2 and certain seals, gaskets, lubricants, etc. Electrodes made of graphite, a form of elemental carbon, which often included tar as binder pitch, were widely used until the 1970s when, in many countries, they were replaced by titanium electrodes. Due in part to their contribution to PCDD/PCDF formation and release, graphite electrodes are not considered Best Available Technique (BAT). Limited data show that far lower levels 106",

      "text": "Toolkit for Identification and Quantification of Releases of Dioxins, Furans and Other Unintentional POPs January 2013 The EDC/VCM/PVC production chain consists of five major processes: 1. EDC production a. Direct chlorination of ethylene using elemental chlorine in the presence of an iron catalyst; and/or b. Oxychlorination of ethylene using hydrogen chloride (HCl) and air or oxygen in the presence of a copper catalyst; 2. Purification of EDC; 3. VCM production via thermal cracking of EDC, which also produces HCl that may be recycled into the oxychlorination process; 4. Purification of VCM; and 5. PVC production via polymerization of VCM. Oxychlorination of ethylene to produce EDC has been described as the most favorable process step in the chemical industry for the formation of PCDD/PCDF (UNEP 2005). However, PCDD/PCDF are also known to occur in other processes in the EDC/VCM/PVC production chain (Weiss and Kandle 2006). Within the EDC/VCM/PVC chain, most EDC production is a balanced mix of direct chlorination and oxychlorination, although some sites are direct chlorination only, or oversized for oxychlorination. Most EDC production is integrated with VCM production on the same site. However, some facilities produce only EDC and ship it elsewhere, and, perhaps more commonly, VCM production facilities ship their VCM elsewhere for polymerization into PVC. PCDD/PCDF can be released to one or more vectors from the production of EDC, VCM, and PVC, as detailed in Annex 48. The acetylene/VCM/PVC production chain entails the following major processes: 1. VCM production via the reaction of acetylene with HCl in the presence of a mercuric chloride catalyst; 2. Purification of VCM; and 3. Polymerization of VCM to form PVC. The acetylene/VCM/PVC production chain is largely used in China, where it accounts for 81% of total PVC production capacity (CMAI 2011b). Little information is available on PCDD/PCDF releases from this production chain other than limited data on releases from acetylene production (Lee et al. 2009, Jin et al. 2009) and in wastewater treatment sludge (USEPA ",

Polychlorinated Biphenyls (PCBs) The total global production of PCBs is estimated at 1.3 to 2 million tons (Breivik et al. 2002, Fiedler 2001). PCBs have been used for a wide range of closed applications (transformers, capacitors) and open applications (sealants, caulking, carbonless paper, plasticizers in paints and cements, casting agents, flame retardant in fabric and heat stabilizing additives for PVC electrical insulation, adhesives, railway sleepers) (Erickson and Kaley 2011). Although PCB production ceased in the 1980s, much PCB‐containing equipment remains in use, materials containing PCBs are being used, and PCB wastes are still awaiting disposal. PCDD/PCDF in commercial PCBs consist mainly of PCDF in the μg/kg to mg/kg range, along with low PCDD concentrations (Takasuga et al. 2005, Huang et al. 2011, Johnson et al. 2008, Wakimoto et al. 1988). The global production of 1.3 to 2 million tons PCBs contained approximately 10,400 to 16,000 kg WHO‐TEQ mainly from dioxin‐like PCBs (Weber et al. 2008). PCDD/PCDF concentrations in used PCBs are largely unknown. Limited data are available on PCDF levels in used PCBs, indicating that,",

PCDD/PCDF concentrations in used PCBs are largely unknown. Limited data are available on PCDF levels in used PCBs, indicating that, for transformers, the levels might be similar as those found in used PCBs (Huang et al. 2011, Masuda et al. 1986). As shown in Table II.10.1, the dioxin‐like TEQ contribution from PCDF in technical PCBs is normally below 10%. When commercial PCBs are subjected to elevated temperatures, PCDD/PCDF concentrations increase as documented for heat exchange fluids in the Yusho incident, where PCDF TEQ levels had considerably increased, reaching similar TEQ levels as for dl‐PCB (Masuda et al. 1986). PCDF formation by thermal treatment of PCB can result in a TEQ increase of the PCB mixture of up to 50 fold (Weber 2007). Sites where PCBs are used or PCB‐containing equipment is stored, dismantled or disposed of can generate local contamination and potential hotspots (see Source Group 10). The first step in estimating the stock and releases of PCDD/PCDF associated with the use and storage of PCB‐containing equipment is to compile a national inventory of the equipment and possibly other PCB legacies. Based on the PCB inventory, total TEQ in this stock can be calculated according to Table II.10.2. The inventory data can be used in combination with PCB leakage rates to estimate the quantity of PCDD/PCDF and dioxin‐like PCBs released annually from the inventoried PCB equipment. The PCB leakage rates depend on a number of factors including the age of the equipment, conditions of exploitation and storage, climatic conditions etc. The precise impact of most of these factors is not well studied. For a preliminary assessment of PCB releases into the environment, emission factors given in the EMEP/EEA Atmospheric Emission Inventory Guidebook (2009) can be used (Table II.10.1). 111\n\n7d | Chlorobenzene Production | Emission Factors (µg TEQ/t product) | | | | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Classification | | Air | Water | Land | Product | Residue 1 | 1,",

Pentachlorophenol (PCP) and Sodium Pentachlorophenate (PCP­Na) PCP or “penta” (CAS 87‐86‐5) and PCP‐Na (CAS 131‐52‐2) are used as pesticides and as preservatives for e.g. wood (indoor and outdoor), leather, textiles (including cotton or wool) and for killing snails in areas where schistosomiasis is epidemic (Zheng et al. 2008, 2011). PCP is also used to produce PCP‐Na and pentachlorophenol laurate (PCPL), which is used on textiles and other fabrics (van der Zande 2010). While there are no recent data on global production, PCP production is estimated at 7,257 tons/year in the U.S. (van der Zande 2010). In 2010, Mexico produced approximately 7,000 tons/year, approximately 80% of which were exported (B. Cardenas, personal communication, 26 November 2012). In China, PCP production was of 10,000 tons/year in 1997 (Ge et al. 2007). PCP is produced by several methods, including the following: 1. Reaction of Cl with liquid phenol, chlorophenol or a polychlorophenol at 30‐40°C to produce 2 2,4,6‐trichlorophenol, which is then converted to PCP by further chlorination at progressively higher temperatures in the presence of catalysts (aluminum, antimony, their chlorides, and others) (Borysiewicz 2008); 2. Alkaline hydrolysis of hexachlorobenzene (HCB) in methanol and dihydric alcohols, in water and mixtures of different solvents in an autoclave at 130 ‐ 170°C (Borysiewicz 2008); and 3. Thermolysis of hexachlorocyclohexane (HCH), including a chlorination step and hydrolysis (Wu 1999",

Thermolysis of hexachlorocyclohexane (HCH), including a chlorination step and hydrolysis (Wu 1999). PCP‐Na was produced until 1984 using the alkaline hydrolysis of hexachlorobenzene. Now, however, it is produced by dissolving PCP flakes in sodium hydroxide solution (Borysiewicz 2008). It has been suggested that post‐production processing of PCP flakes from the latter process accounted for more extensive exposure to PCP and its contaminants than did production (Ruder 2011). PCDD/PCDF are by‐products in all of these manufacturing methods (Borysiewicz 2008). In addition, the method based on alkaline hydrolysis of HCB can result in the presence of HCB in the resulting PCP. Commercial PCP may contain up to 0.1% of PCDD/PCDF, which are released to the air from PCP‐ treated products, released to water when PCP‐treated textiles and other products are washed, and concentrated in the sludge of wastewater facilities that treat the washwater. PCP‐derived PCDD/PCDF are released to air and land from in‐service wood products, such as utility poles and railroad ties (Borysiewicz 2008), when sewage sludge is land applied, and when PCP‐treated products are burned. PCDD/PCDF may also be brought into a country through the import of PCP as well as PCP‐treated products such as wood and wood products, furniture, textiles, and leather. Tracing these flows can be very difficult. The impact on emission factors of burning PCP‐contaminated wood can be seen in source category 3d ‐ Household Heating and Cooking with Biomass. PCP‐treated materials also contribute to higher releases from open burning processes as can be seen in source category 6b ‐ Waste Burning and Accidental Fires. 112",

Chlorinated Paraffins (CPs) CPs are straight‐chain hydrocarbons that have been chlorinated. Chlorinated paraffins are classified according to their carbon‐chain length and percentage of chlorination, with carbon‐chain lengths generally ranging from C to C and chlorination from approximately 35% to greater than 10 30 70% by weight. Around 40 CAS numbers have been used to describe the whole chlorinated paraffin family, e.g., CPs of unspecified length are CAS 63449‐39‐8. CPs are made by reacting Cl with paraffin fractions obtained from petroleum distillation. The three 2 most common commercial feedstocks used are short‐chain (C ), medium‐chain (C ) and long‐ 10‐13 14‐17 chain (C ) paraffins. Global production of CPs is estimated at 1 million tons/yr, some 70% of which 18‐30 is produced in China (Takasuga et al. 2012). The largest use of CPs is in industrial cutting fluids, particularly in the manufacture of automobiles and automobile parts. In addition, they are used in commercial paints, adhesives, sealant and caulks as well as plasticizers in PVC and flame retardants in other plastics and rubber. Relatively high concentrations of PCDD/PCDF, total PCBs and HCB have been reported in samples of technical long‐chain CPs (Takasuga et al. 2012).

It is also used as a fungicide and for seed treatment, although such uses are prohibited in some countries. In China, about 2,000 tons of chloranil are produced and used as a fungicide, as an intermediate in the synthesis of medicines and pesticides, and as an oxidizing agent used in organic synthesis, particularly for dye intermediates (Liu et al. 2012). Two methods for producing p‐chloranil are as follows: 1. The process of direct chlorination of phenol using Cl , which produces both o‐ and p‐chloranil 2 was developed and used in Germany until 1990. This may still be used by producers in other countries. 116",

The more widely used process begins with the conversion of phenol to hydroquinone, followed by the reaction of hydroquinone with Cl or hydrogen peroxide and hydrochloric 2 acid to form p‐chloranil. PCDD/PCDF contamination in chloranil is transferred to dyestuffs, pigments, inks, etc. and other products made from chloranil (see chloranil‐derived pigments and dyes below). PCDD/PCDF in chloranil‐derived materials are further transferred into the production processes of textiles, polymers/plastics, and packaging materials (paper, tin cans, etc.) and released in process outputs (see, for example, Source Category 7g – Textile Production). When textiles, clothing and other consumer goods treated with chloranil‐based pigments and dyes are washed, some portion of the PCDD/PCDF is carried into domestic and municipal wastewater, where it contributes to PCDD/PCDF in wastewater treatment effluents and sludge. When the consumer goods are discarded or recycled, the PCDD/PCDF that originated during chloranil production adds to PCDD/PCDF contamination in disposal and recycling processes. In paper recycling and textile production and dyeing, PCDD/PCDF will be released into water and/or concentrated in the residue (sludge).

Caprolactam (2­Azacycloheptanone) Caprolactam (CAS 105‐60‐2) is produced commercially by two methods. Only one entails the use of chlorine in some form: the reaction of HCl with nitrosylsulfuric acid to produce nitrosyl chloride which is then reacted with cyclohexane and HCl to produce cyclohexanone which undergoes further reactions to produce caprolactam. In 2010, global production of caprolactam was 3.8 million metric tons (SRI Consulting 2011). Virtually all caprolactam is used to produce Nylon 6. PCDD/PCDF have been detected in air emissions, process wastewater and in treated wastewater from caprolactam production facilities in two countries (Lee et al. 2009, Kawamoto 2002, Hong and Xu 2012). These findings suggest that PCDD/PCDF are likely also to occur in residues, including those from wastewater treatment.

Particular attention is needed in the development of the PCDD/PCDF inventory for this source category to avoid double counting of releases from power boilers. • Coking units use heat to thermally crack heavy hydrocarbon streams to form lighter, more useful distillates such as heating oils or gasoline. Traditional fluid coking units are one of the largest vent emissions sources at a refinery, being comparable to emissions from the CCU regenerator. • Catalytic reforming units are a series of catalytic reactors that turn naphtha into high‐octane gasoline. The catalyst accumulates carbon (coke) so that it must be regenerated. In the continuous process, aged catalyst is continuously moved from the reactor to the regenerator where the carbon is burned from the catalyst with hot air/steam. Chlorine or organochlorines , such as tri‐ or perchloroethylene, are added to retain catalytic activity. While the catalytic reactors have no direct process vents, the catalyst regenerators do have such vents. • Flares are compulsory safety equipment used both for safety reasons during upsets, start‐up, shut down, and system blow‐down and for managing the disposal of waste gases from routine operations. PCDD/PCDF may be released to air from vent stacks and flares, captured in scrubbing systems and released to water in treated effluents, and released in residues such as exhausted catalysts and wastewater treatment sludge. Emission Factors Emission factors for calculating releases of PCDD and PCDF from petroleum refineries are presented below for the following processes: • Flaring of gases released from the petroleum industry • Catalytic reforming unit (including catalyst regenerator) • Coking unit • Refinery‐wide wastewater treatment PCDD/PCDF emission factors are listed in Tables II.7.26 and II.7.27.

Except in certain cases, these processes are only routes of PCDD/PCDF release, not sources of PCDD/PCDF formation and release. PCDD/PCDF that are already present in the wastes being treated become concentrated or released to one or more vectors by these treatment and disposal processes (see Table II.9.1). These processes are used to dispose of PCDD/PCDF‐contaminated wastes, many of which are residues of processes that have been addressed in other source groups. The management of these residues, e.g. physical, biological, chemical, or thermal treatment or containment in secure landfills, burial in dumps and pits, spreading on land, or direct discharge of untreated effluents into rivers, lakes or oceans, can result in PCDD/PCDF releases to the environment. The fate of PCDD/PCDF‐containing residues should be well‐documented, because of the potential for mismanagement to result in increased and widespread exposure in humans and domestic animals. As an example, the Belgian chicken incident originated in a small volume of used PCB oil (contaminated with PCDF) being introduced into fat subsequently used for producing feedstuff for domestic animals (EU SCAN 2000).

Where no collection systems are installed, landfill gases and leachate escape from the dump in an uncontrolled manner. While PCDD/PCDF have not been quantified/reported in landfill gases, they are known to occur in landfill leachate or seepage and, in some cases, nearby soils. Combustion of landfill gases in flares and other devices is addressed in source category 3c and releases due to open burning of waste at landfills and dumps are addressed in source category 6b. Landfill mining A large amount of PCDD/PCDF and other unintentional POPs have been deposited over the last century in landfills and dumpsites, with the largest reservoirs stemming from chlorine and organochlorine production (see Source Group 10). Landfill mining and reclamation, or excavation/remediation of landfills is a process whereby solid wastes which have previously been landfilled are excavated and processed. The objectives of landfill mining/reclamation and excavation/remediation can be threefold: • Recovery of land and landfill space • Recovery of materials • Environmental protection and remediation As an example, PCDD/PCDF contaminated lime has been mined from a landfill containing residues from VCM/EDC production (Torres et al. 2012). This contaminated lime was partially used for neutralization of citrus pulp which was subsequently used as feedstuff for cattle in Europe. This resulted in contamination of milk and dairy products in several European countries (Torres et al. 2012, Malisch 2000; see example inventory 10). The excavation of landfills for remediation purposes reduces or prevents releases of more water soluble compounds contaminating groundwater, surface water or drinking water. Excavation can also be undertaken due to long term cost considerations and to avoid burdening future generations. The quantity of PCDD/PCDF in landfills being excavated is site specific and needs to be individually assessed in each case (Forter 2006, Torres et al. 2012, Weber et al. 2008). The excavation and remediation activities of landfills containing wastes from organochlorine industries or other wastes highly contaminated with PCDD/PCDF must also consider the risks of occupational exposure to PCDD/PCDF.

Sewage, also called wastewater, typically includes human feces and urine, bathwater, water used in washing clothes and other items, and, in some cases, storm water run‐off and industrial wastewater.

Sewage treatment ranges from simple removal of large solids by coarse screening to further solids removal in settling ponds, biological and chemical treatment, disinfection, reverse osmosis filtration and other advanced technologies. These commonly used sewage treatment methods produce an aqueous effluent and a solid residue, sewage sludge. PCDD/PCDF concentrations in treated effluent are ordinarily low. However, when chlorine is used to disinfect treated effluent, PCDD/PCDF concentrations can increase, in some cases, by as much as 50‐fold (Pujadas et al. 2001). Most of the PCDD/PCDF found in sewage and, subsequently, in treated effluent and sewage sludge originate in 132\n\n9a | Landfills and Waste Dumps | Emission Factors (µg TEQ/t waste disposed of) | | | | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ Classification | | Air | Water | Land | Product | Residue 1 | Hazardous wastes | NA | 5 | NA | NA | NA* 2 | Mixed wastes | NA | 0.5 | NA | NA | 50 3 | Domestic wastes | NA | 0.05 | NA | NA | 5",

For many years, PCDD/PCDF have been reported in sewage sludge of many countries (Clarke et al. 2008). Decreasing trends have been reported in countries such as Germany and Austria, as well as in Spain (Martinez et al. 2007, De la Torre et al. 2011). The management of sludge can also result in releases of PCDD/PCDF. For example, land application of sludge can lead to increased PCDD/PCDF in soils (Molina et al. 2000, Rideout and Teschke 2004), in certain vegetation grown on sludge‐treated soils (Engwall and Hjelm 2000), and in the tissues and other products of animals that forage on PCDD/PCDF‐contaminated soils (Schuler et al. 1997, Rideout and Teschke 2004). Likewise, sludge buried in landfills may contribute to PCDD/PCDF in landfill leachates (De la Torre et al. 2011). Untreated sewage from remote, undeveloped and non‐industrialized areas is expected to have relatively low PCDD/PCDF concentrations. Low concentrations may be also expected in countries with stringent controls on discharges of industrial wastewater to sewers, effective controls on the use of PCP, other biocides and dyes and pigments on textiles, and bans on the use of chlorine‐bleached toilet paper. Higher levels can be expected in urban areas with mixed industry and use of PCDD/PCDF‐contaminated consumer goods.

With more advanced treatment – such as biological and chemical treatment ‐ most PCDD/PCDF are likely to be concentrated in the sludge. The amount of PCDD/PCDF in the effluent is likely to be influenced by the amount of suspended solids remaining in the effluent. Emission Factors PCDD/PCDF emission factors for three source classes are listed in Table II.9.4. Revised or newly added emission factors are highlighted in red. Detailed information on how these emission factors have been derived can be found in Annex 53. Guidance for classification of sources Class 1 should be applied where, besides normal domestic effluents, industrial effluents with a potential to contain PCDD/PCDF as described for categories 1 to 8 are collected in the same sewer system. Class 2 should be applied for urban, industrial areas without specific potential to contain PCDD/PCDF. Class 3 should be applied to remote areas with no known PCDD/PCDF sources and urban areas with only domestic inputs. Table II.9.4 PCDD/PCDF emission factors for source category 9b Sewage and Sewage Treatment 9b Sewage and Sewage Treatment Emission factors 12 Biogenic formation of PCDD/PCDF from dioxin precursors like chlorophenols has been reported in sewage sludge by some authors. However, biological transformation cannot be quantified in terms of emission factors. Since the use of chlorophenol (including PCP) has decreased the last decades, this source can be considered as not relevant. PCDD/PCDF may also be produced where sludge is thermally dried. 133\n\n9b | Sewage and Sewage Treatment | Emission factors ---------------------------------------------------\n\nClassification |  | Air | Water (pg\nTEQ/L) | Land* | Product =\nResidue (µg TEQ/t\nd.m.)\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n1 | Mixed domestic and specific\nindustrial inputs** | NA\nNA | 10a\n1b |  | NAa\n200b\n2 | Urban and industrial inputs | NA\nNA | 1a\n0.2",

Feedstocks for composting include a wide variety of materials, e.g., kitchen and garden waste, sewage sludge, agricultural crop residues, some industrial wastes, animal manures and human excreta. PCDD/PCDF values in compost in Europe were between 3 and 12 ng TEQ/kg (Brändli et al. 2005, 2008). In Brazil, organic composts (separated at source) had an average PCDD/PCDF content of 14 ng TEQ/kg (Grossi et al. 1998). However, composts produced from mixed waste where organic fractions have been separated after collection (“grey compost”) had an average of 57 ng TEQ/kg, with a maximum of 150 ng TEQ/kg in metropolitan areas, and an average of 27 ng TEQ/kg in small towns (Grossi et al. 1998). Compost impacted from pulp and paper sludge using Kraft process also had high values (99 ng TEQ/kg). These “grey” composts with levels of 50 ng TEQ/kg and higher are not considered suitable for agriculture or horticulture in Europe. However, standards differ among other regions and countries.

Detailed information on how these emission factors have been derived can be found in Annex 53.

Level of Confidence The emission factor values have been assigned a high level of confidence. Nevertheless, uncertainties exist where organic industrial residues are used (e.g. from pulp and paper industry). 9e Waste Oil Treatment (Non­thermal) The estimate of PCDD/PCDF releases from waste oil treatment is difficult for several reasons. Firstly, there is no clear definition of “used” oil or “waste” oil. For the purpose of the Toolkit, waste oils (or used oils) are defined as any petroleum‐based, synthetic, or plant‐ or animal‐based oil that has been used. Waste oils may originate from two large sources: used industrial oils, and vegetable or animal waste oils. Among the industrial waste oils, three main oil streams can be identified: industrial oil (for example, hydraulic oil, engine lubricant, cutting oil); garage or workshop oil; and transformer oil. More information can be found in the BAT&BEP Guidelines. Waste oils have been found to be contaminated with PCDD/PCDF and PCB. PCB‐containing oils from transformers are addressed in source category 10f. At present there is no evidence that PCDD/PCDF or PCB are newly formed in waste oil refineries. The data available indicate that PCDD/PCDF and PCB released from waste oil refineries or waste oil handling and management plants are from the industrial, intentional production of PCB or chlorobenzenes that are present in waste oils either by contamination in the synthesis process (of these chemicals) or have become contaminated during the use phase or earlier recycling processes. More information can be found in the BAT&BEP Guidelines. Waste oil collected in countries will end up in other processes and has to be included in the categories on waste incineration (1a and 1b), power plants (3a), domestic heating and cooking (3e), cement kilns (4a), brickworks (4c), asphalt mixing stations (4f), or transportation (5d).

Improper disposal may result in contamination of land or water. It can be assumed that a site‐ or process‐specific evaluation has to be performed.

This source group includes an indicative list of activities that might have resulted in the contamination of soils and sediments with PCDD/PCDF and other unintentional POPs, including related deposits. PCDD/PCDF from reservoirs including contaminated sites and hotspots represent nowadays an important source of human exposure, often through food contamination: recent accidents involving food and animal feedstuff in Europe have been caused by historic PCDD/PCDF contamination from past production of chlorinated organics and contaminated sites (Fiedler et al. 2000b, Torres et al. 2012, Weber et al. 2008a,b) highlighting that PCDD/PCDF are released from these sources into the food chain. The procedure comprises three tasks: I. Identifying historical activities that could have caused contamination and identifying the potentially contaminated sites; II. Assessing these sites for the likely magnitude of the contamination and ranking by their exposure risk; III. Assessing the degree of contamination of the most significant sites by detailed analysis. Steps for identification, ranking and detailed assessment of the sites I. Identifying potentially contaminated sites A wide variety of PCDD/PCDF sources exists worldwide, which has likely resulted in a large number of (potentially) contaminated sites through historic releases. The Toolkit shows that the strength of the various PCDD/PCDF sources varies by several orders of magnitude. Therefore, a prioritization of contaminated sites from historic sources needs to consider the total amount of PCDD/PCDF that was likely produced from the respective sources, the related management schemes and former destruction efforts. Often, details on the management of historic releases are not known, therefore a tiered approach is needed to inventory and categorize sites. The largest amounts of PCDD/PCDF and other unintentional POPs were generated in the production processes of organochlorine chemicals, in particular of PCDD/PCDF precursors such as chlorophenols, PCB or other chlorinated aromatic compounds. Tens to hundreds of kg TEQ of historic deposits have been documented for single factories (Götz et al. 2012, Verta et al. 2010, Forter 2006); amounts of the same order of magnitude were recorded for single",

The same is true for unintentionally produced HCB, where single factories have disposed of HCB wastes in the order of 10,000 tons (Weber et al. 2011b, Vijgen et al. 2011). The following source groups should be considered when setting priorities for establishing inventories and assessing sites potentially contaminated with PCDD/PCDF and other unintentional POPs, as well as (historic) stockpiles of contaminated wastes13: • Production of chlorine (in particular chlor‐alkali processes having used graphite electrodes). 13 The list is established according to the life cycle of chlorine and organochlorine compounds. 137",

Monitoring data are rarely available before the development of an inventory. A listing of contaminated sites is therefore prepared based only on information on historic activities having likely resulted in high releases of PCDD/PCDF and other unintentional POPs over the last century. Consequently, in the initial stage of inventory development, the sites related to the above listed high priority activities can be categorized without a detailed assessment as “potentially polluted sites”. Using this simple approach (Tier 1), a wide range of “potentially polluted sites” can initially be listed. Often, in this stage, only the factories and areas surrounding the known or suspected sources can be identified as “potentially polluted”, without knowing details on e.g. deposits, polluted soil or sediments. These sites will be included in a list or a database of contaminated sites, noting that further investigations are needed. II.

In this tier 2 assessment, the detailed location of potentially contaminated sites is assessed, in particular production sites, related landfills and dump sites, rivers and lakes having received releases, and areas where air releases have been deposited. These sites can be identified as “likely contaminated sites” or “contaminated sites”, depending on PCDD/PCDF contamination levels. Such data might be documented in archives of the respective companies or competent authorities responsible for factory inspection/audits. In addition, data from factories with similar production or technologies may be used for a first semi‐quantitative estimate. Tier 2 might already include a first screening of PCDD/PCDF contamination at suspected sites with high human exposure risk to assess/confirm PCDD/PCDF pollution and facilitate appropriate action. Based on the compilation of this information, the site can be listed in the inventory as a (likely) polluted site, and the need for a further detailed assessment should be noted.

A preliminary risk assessment for each site/hotspot should be made in order to establish the necessary national priorities, so that in case of limited available budgets, the most urgent sites can be selected and dealt with accordingly. III. Detailed assessment of the most significant contaminated sites In the third phase (Tier 3), a detailed assessment of the site is conducted including field measurements to assess the extent of contamination in soils, sediments and possibly ground and surface water (for the more water‐soluble unintentional POPs). This assessment also includes an evaluation of potential releases and human exposure via all relevant pathways. Detailed records of the location of the sites should be compiled e.g. places where the potentially contaminating operations took place and where associated wastes have been disposed of, ideally using geospatial data. The current use of the site and any associated human exposure risks should also be assessed and recorded. A detailed risk assessment and a conceptual site model might also be developed at this stage. Details on assessing POPs contaminated sites have been compiled in the following documents and are not further described: a) UNIDO “POP contaminated site investigation and management toolkit”, which aims at assisting developing countries in the identification, classification and prioritization of POPs‐ contaminated sites (http://www.unido.org/index.php?id=1001169). The report can be downloaded from the internet.14 b) World Bank “The Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPs) Toolkit”, which provides training modules and interactive tools for risk‐based approaches to prioritize and manage POPs‐ contaminated sites and other hazardous substances (http://www.popstoolkit.com/). A series of practical examples and best practice cases of PCDD/PCDF inventories for the most relevant source categories is included in the example inventory 11 including, where available, quantitative PCDD/PCDF data. It is important to note that polluted sites, in particular at larger chemical production sites, are often impacted by a range of pollutants; contamination with PCDD/PCDF and other unintentional POPs may be coupled with pollution by other organohalogen compounds or heavy metals, which would also be included in the assessment of the site.

All these aspects should be taken into account in the identification and inventory process of polluted sites. The identification and inventory of polluted sites is merely a first step to manage related risks and for final cleanup and rehabilitation. A certain system of polluted sites management should thus be set up. Polluted sites databases and registers The inventory data should finally be integrated in a national database of contaminated sites.

Such national databases of contaminated sites have been developed over the last three decades in certain countries. For example, the United States Superfund program15 is based on such a national inventory compilation of contaminated sites (see example inventory for source category 10l). Canada has a federal contaminated sites inventory which is publicly available, including PCDD/PCDF and PCB as listed pollutants.16 Some countries have developed and published transparent guidelines to develop such inventories e.g. the Swedish EPA (Swedish EPA 2002). Specific global or regional contaminated sites databases have also been established e.g. by the Blacksmith Institute (www.worstpolluted.org), Robin des Bois organization (www.robindesbois.org), the HCH and Pesticide Association (www.ihpa.info) (Vijgen et al. 2011). The development of such inventories of contaminated sites can be framed by legislation requiring their establishment for the protection of future generation, and/or protection and management of soils and water resources. The European Commission has established such a requirement in the proposal of a soil framework directive (EC 2006).17 If a country already has a national database of contaminated sites, the information gathered via inventories of sites contaminated with PCDD/PCDF and other unintentional POPs will be added to the existing database. If such a database does not exist in a country, the establishment of a contaminated site inventory can initiate the development of a national contaminated sites inventory database. Using the three phase approach the different categories and sites within the categories can be ranked and assessed according the priority setting based on risks. These assessments are also included in the contaminated sites inventory database. 10a Production Sites of Chlorine Certain processes for the manufacture of chlorine have been associated with high formation and releases of PCDD/PCDF and other unintentional POPs (Weber et al. 2008). In addition to well‐ documented releases from the chlor‐alkali process (Otto et al. 2006), earlier chlorine production using the Weldon or Deacon process has also resulted in PCDD/PCDF contaminated sites (Balzer et al. 2007, 2008).

In addition to well‐ documented releases from the chlor‐alkali process (Otto et al. 2006), earlier chlorine production using the Weldon or Deacon process has also resulted in PCDD/PCDF contaminated sites (Balzer et al. 2007, 2008). I. Chlor­alkali production The manufacture of chlorine using graphite anodes generates PCDD/PCDF contamination of the residues. Contamination levels close to 4 mg TEQ/kg in chlor‐alkali residues have been reported; contaminated soil samples ranged from 0.15 μg I‐TEQ/kg to 23.1 μg I‐TEQ/kg (She and Hagenmaier 1994, Otto et al. 2006). The only chlor‐alkali production site for which a PCDD/PCDF inventory has been published was operated in Rheinfelden/Germany. The deposited residues and contaminated soils were estimated to contain a total of 8.5 kg I‐TEQ PCDD/PCDF from residues of the chlor‐alkali process (see example 10aI). Chlorine was produced almost exclusively using graphite anodes until it was gradually replaced by metal anodes and other technologies starting with the 1970s. The graphite residue was highly 15 http://www.epa.gov/superfund 16 http://www.tbs‐sct.gc.ca/fcsi‐rscf/home‐accueil‐eng.aspx 17 COM(2006)232, http://ec.europa.eu/environment/soil/three_en.htm 140",

In developing regions, graphite anodes have been used until recently and might possibly still be in use. Primary locations for contamination from these operations include soil and, if leaching has occurred, neighbouring compartments and eventually sediments of nearby rivers. High concentrations of mercury could be an indicator for contamination with PCDD/PCDF as well. Barium levels in the deposited chlor‐alkali residues were also found to be a useful and inexpensive monitoring parameter for tracking contamination of residues and deposits. This approach has been used for screening and mapping a German site impacted by widespread chlor‐alkali residues (Otto et al. 2006; see example 10aI). II. Leblanc process and associated chlorine/bleach production High concentrations of PCDF (and minor concentrations of PCDD) were formed by Leblanc Soda and associated processes. PCDD/PCDF levels of up to 500 µg TEQ/kg have been reported in deposits from a former German Leblanc factory (Balzer et al. 2007, 2008; see example 10aII). The Leblanc process was extensively used until early 20th century to produce sal soda/sodium carbonate (Na CO ) from 2 3 sodium chloride (NaCl). The waste from this process (HCl) was recycled in some facilities by oxidation to produce chlorine/calcium hypochlorite (bleaching powder) either via manganese oxide (Weldon process) or by CuCl catalysts (Deacon process) (Weber et al. 2008, Encyclopaedia Britannica 1911). 2 The major source of PCDD/PCDF precursors was coal tar which was used as a filler and surface protection material. In addition to PCDD/PCDF, other unintentional POPs and chlorinated aromatic compounds were formed (Takasuga et al. 2009, Bogdal et al. 2008). Leblanc factories were predominantly operated in the UK, France and Germany with a few facilities in other European countries (Balzer et al. 2008; see example 10aII).

Leblanc factories were predominantly operated in the UK, France and Germany with a few facilities in other European countries (Balzer et al. 2008; see example 10aII). For inventories of former Leblanc factory sites, it is important to assess if the factory recycled HCl to chlorine/bleach, as recycling would be associated with high PCDD/PCDF levels in the wastes and likely contamination of the land where these wastes were deposited. In addition, PCDD/PCDF contamination has been found in areas where Leblanc ovens have been operated and since demolished (Balzer et al. 2008). 10b Production Sites of Chlorinated Organics The largest PCDD/PCDF contaminated sites and hotspots have been generated by the production and application of chlorinated organics. For some production processes, other unintentional POPs were/are major residues. Furthermore, considerable quantities of product, either remaining in the residues or as faulty batches, were deposited on or close to the production sites. A prime example is lindane/HCHs, with only approximately 15% of the total mass emerging as product, and the remaining 85% representing HCH waste isomers, dumped in the vicinity of the production facilities. The production of DDT and endosulfan also generate large amounts of wastes containing POPs which have often been landfilled. Wastes from the organochlorine industry are now destroyed in BAT/BEP incinerators in developed regions. However, these wastes were often landfilled or dumped until the 1970s/1980s. In developing regions, such wastes might still be landfilled nowadays. The inventory of such production sites and related contaminated sites should consider: • The former and current production portfolio should be assessed for chemicals containing or possibly containing PCDD/PCDF, HCB or other unintentional POPs (see Annex 2 and example 10bIII).

However the production of non‐aromatic chemicals like chlorinated solvents has also generated wastes containing unintentional POPs e.g. 10,000 tons of unintentionally produced HCB from single production sites (Weber et al. 2011). • Former and current management practices for waste residues should be reviewed and an inventory of related production sites, stockpiles and landfills should be developed (see examples 10bII and 10bIII). • Contamination with PCDD/PCDF of buildings and soil is likely to be found at current or former production sites of chlorinated organics. • If wastewater was discharged into receiving waters, sediments and floodplains of entire river systems or bays can be contaminated (see example 10bI). • If wastewater has been allowed to settle in ponds, sediment or sludge from these settling ponds can contain high concentrations of PCDD/PCDF. I. Production sites of chlorophenol High concentrations of PCDD/PCDF can be expected at sites where chlorinated phenols were produced. In the case of Times Beach, USA, where production residues were spread, contaminated soils have been reported as having concentrations of up to 33,000,000 ng TEQ/kg (Rappe 1984). Levels around factories can be as high as 200,000 ng TEQ/kg (di Domenico et al. 1982). Where production residues have been released via water discharge, sediments can be polluted with tens of kg TEQ (Verta et al. 2008; see example 10bI). PCDD/PCDF in related deposits are reported to total 7.7 kg TEQ for a PCP production facility in Germany (Otto et al. 2006; see example 10bI) and 22.3 kg from a 2,4,5‐T production site also located in Germany (Götz et al. 2012).

Former lindane production where HCH waste isomers have been recycled In the production of lindane (gamma‐HCH), approximately 85% HCH waste isomers are formed in the chlorination step of benzene as unintentional POPs (Vijgen et al. 2011). The active gamma‐isomer used to be separated and the remaining 85 to 90% waste isomers, consisting mainly of alpha‐HCH and some beta, delta and epsilon‐HCH, were dumped. This practice has generated the largest international POPs stockpile, estimated at 4 to 7 million tons, often dumped in the vicinity of the factories (Vijgen 2006a,b, Vijgen et al. 2011). To avoid such dumping, waste isomers have been recycled at some production sites (Vijgen et al. 2011; see example 10bII). Recycling of HCH by thermal decomposition to produce technical tri/tetrachlorbenzene generated highly contaminated residues containing 1.4 to 13% PCDD/PCDF with I‐TEQ in the high ppm range (90 to 610 ppm) (Vijgen et al. 2011, Zheng et al. 1999). The total PCDD/PCDF amount in registered waste disposed of by a German factory was estimated to be between 333 and 854 kg PCDD/PCDF I‐TEQ (53 ‐102 tons total PCDD/PCDF) (Götz et al. 2012; see example 10bII). Since the recycling of HCH waste has been carried out at several lindane production sites, related contamination can also be expected at these sites (Vijgen et al. 2011). III.

Emission factors for most residues are currently not available and will depend on the specific technologies used. Detailed data for the inventory need to be generated for the individual sites including information on the (former) products and intermediates and the respective management and disposal procedures. These production sites and related deposits can be inventoried as potentially contaminated with PCDD/PCDF, noting that “further assessment is necessary”. As an example, an inventory has been compiled for the production wastes generated and landfilled by the Basel Chemical Industry (see example 10bIII). IV. Production sites of chlorinated solvents and other “HCB waste” In the production of certain solvents (e.g. carbon tetrachloride, tetrachloroethene, trichlorobenzenes, trichloroethene, trichlorotoluenes), large amount of wastes containing HCB as a prime contaminant (“HCB waste”) are generated (Jacoff et al. 1986, Jones et al. 2005). For one facility, an emission factor of 1.8% was calculated on the basis of the solvents produced (see example 10bIV; Weber et al. 2011b). Other studies have estimated that 4% of “HCB waste” is generated from tetrachloroethene production. For some solvent production, it is reported that individual factories have deposited or stored some 10,000 tons HCB waste (Weber et al. 2011a,b). Some of these wastes also contained relevant levels of PeCB (see example 10bIV). For an inventory of deposits and dumps from solvent production, the following steps are recommended: • Establish the total quantities of organochlorine solvent produced at the site. • Establish whether specific factors for factory‐generated wastes or data on the total deposited wastes are available. Otherwise a factor of 2% “HCB waste” for the solvents mentioned above can be used. • Assess the waste management practices over time i.e. the time over which the wastes have been deposited, when improved treatment/destruction capacity for production residues was added. • Map and assess the deposits, associated",

HCB is also the prime unintentional POP contaminant in the production of certain pesticides (e.g. PCNB, PCP, dacthal, daconil, hexachlorcyclopentadiene) (Jacoff et al. 1986) and of tetrachlorophthalic acid and related dyes such as chlorinated phthalocyanines (Government of Japan 2007). A similar approach to the assessment of “HCB waste” from solvents can be used for these sites. V. (Former) PCB and PCB­containing materials/equipment production PCB and PCB‐containing materials (varnish/paints, sealants, etc.) were produced at chemical plants, and PCB‐containing equipment at electrotechnical plants. According to Fedorov (2003) and Ishankulov (2008), annual releases of PCB into the environment from production processes of PCB‐ containing capacitors at the Ust‐Kamenogorsk plant in Kazakhstan generated some 188‐227 tons PCB (10‐12% of the total PCB used). These releases lead to significant environmental contamination with PCB and PCDD/PCDF, in particular at production sites. These sites can thus be treated as potential hotspots. In addition, storage sites of solid waste and sewage sludge from such facilities are also potential hotspots. 143",

Dioxin‐containing herbicides/pesticides such as 2,4,5‐T, 2,4‐D, PCP or others have been applied in agriculture or for clearing vegetation. In Vietnam, spraying of the defoliant Agent Orange and other 2,4,5‐T/2,4‐D containing agents during 1963‐1970 caused extensive environmental contamination and human exposure (Schecter 1994, Allen 2004) releasing some 366 kg TEQ (Stellmann et al. 2003). A comprehensive inventory for historic agricultural pesticide use (mainly PCP and CNP) has been established for Japan and is estimated at 460 kg TEQ, having migrated partly from agricultural fields to river sediments and sea (see example 10c). The human milk contamination measured in Japan today is correlated to former pesticide use (Tawara et al. 2006, Weber et al. 2008). The use of other organochlorine chemicals having resulted in large contaminated sites are e.g. solvents such as tetrachloethene or trichlorethene, which can be contaminated with HCB and PeCB. For establishing a country inventory, either own PCDD/PCDF data measured from historic pesticides and other chemicals, or emission factors established by other studies might be used (see example 10c).

Soils and sediments can be contaminated with PCDD/PCDF as these industries use large volumes of water and are often located close to rivers. The application of PCP in Sweden, for example, has released between 5 and 50 kg TEQ on these sites, and a further 200 kg TEQ in the product (Swedish Environmental Protection Agency 2005). As PCP and PCP‐Na have a much higher water solubility and shorter half‐lives, the concentration of PCP in soils or sediments can only give approximate indications of PCDD/PCDF contamination. Inventories can be established using former application quantities and contamination levels. In addition to an inventory of PCP application sites, a rough inventory of former PCP use and related PCDD/PCDF in treated wood might be established. 144",

Contaminated sites or hotspots can be expected at production sites where these chemicals have been stored, used and discharged. In particular, adjacent sediments and waste deposits are likely to be contaminated. Areas where sludges from production or from wastewater treatment have been applied can also be contaminated and should be included in the inventory. 10f Use of PCB The use of PCB has generated a large number of sites and hotspots contaminated with PCDF and dioxin‐like PCB via production, use in industries, releases from equipment and open applications (see examples 10fI and 10fII). Commercial mixtures of PCB contain dioxin‐like PCB, non‐dioxin‐like PCB and PCDF, with a major TEQ contribution (> 90%) from dioxin‐like PCB (Takasuga et al. 2005). PCDF releases can only be estimated based on of the amount of PCB leaked. For this assessment, the total TEQ of PCDF and dioxin‐like PCB needs to be considered. With the increasing age of the equipment and longer time of operation, PCDF concentrations in equipment fillings increase, and in the case of high thermal stress (fire event, short circuit) PCDF become the main TEQ contributor. About 60% of the total volume of PCB was used as dielectric fluids in transformers and power capacitors globally (Breivik et al. 2007, Willis 2000). The open uses of PCB, largely as sealants and paints in buildings and in industrial installations, can be considered as hotspots. If the transformers and capacitors are in a good condition and well maintained, with no leakage, PCB and PCDF are not released into the environment. Once the equipment is leaking, PCDF together with PCB and possibly PeCB will subsequently be released into the surroundings, in soils and sediments. PCB can serve as an indicator for PCDF contamination. Sites with PCB‐containing equipment in use or storage should be treated as potential hotspots. The number of such sites per country may be rather large (see example 10fI; Kukharchyk",

Baseline approach The basis for hotspots accounting is the national inventory of PCB according to Annex A, Part II of the Stockholm Convention. All sites where PCB‐containing equipment can be found in use or storage are treated as hotspots. The baseline approach allows the assessment of the total number of potential hotspots, total volumes of PCB and PCDD/PCDF in PCB‐containing equipment, as well as potential leakages of PCB and PCDD/PCDF into the environment, using the results of the national PCB inventory. To differentiate between lower and higher chlorinated PCB congeners, as needed for estimating PCDD/PCDF releases, it can generally be assumed that capacitors are filled with lower chlorinated PCB, while transformers include higher chlorinated PCB with associated PCDD/PCDF levels (Table II.10.1). For a preliminary assessment of PCB releases into the environment, emission factors given in the EMEP/EEA Atmospheric Emission Inventory Guidebook (2009) may be used (Table II.10.1). Using data on the volumes of lower and higher chlorinated PCB and PCDD/PCDF content in PCB liquids (Table II.10.2), it is possible to estimate PCDD/PCDF and dioxin‐like PCB content in PCB equipment and their environmental releases.

It should contain the details of the location, coordinates, facility name, type and number of PCB‐containing equipment, volume of PCB and the state of the equipment. This list can then serve as a basis for further investigation of hotspots. 2. Detailed approach The detailed approach is used when the results of the national PCB inventory are partial, inaccurate or not applicable for the identification of hotspots. In such cases, additional questionnaires are sent to governmental bodies, state offices or directly to facilities which hold or operate PCB‐containing equipment. In addition to usual questions on the number of PCB‐filled equipment, the questionnaires should also enquire on PCB leaks, accidents involving such equipment, description of sites with PCB, results of analysis of PCB in soils and water etc. 3. Comprehensive approach Through the comprehensive approach, in addition to the results of the national PCB inventory and/or questionnaires to owners of PCB‐filled equipment, special investigations of PCB‐filled equipment or storage sites are organised, including on‐site inspection, soil and other media sampling and analysis, estimation of polluted areas, volumes of leakages, PCB stocks in soil, depth of pollution, risk assessment etc. During the first stages, priority should be given to sites with the largest stocks of PCB‐filled equipment, sites with accidents and significant leakages and sites with the highest risk of water and soil pollution. The results of such a comprehensive inventory allow the preparation of a detailed register of hotspots, with the indication of their prioritisation for remediation measures. As for the presentation of results of the hotspot inventory (applying the baseline and detailed approach), these can be included in the relevant Excel file (in Source Group 10); the number of identified hotspots, volumes of PCB in equipment (and distribution between lower and higher chlorinated congeners) are needed as input to estimate PCDD/PCDF releases from these sources. For the comprehensive inventory, separate reports are prepared. 10g Use of Chlorine for Production of Metals and Inorganic Chemicals In addition to organochlorine industry, chlorine was/is used in a range of other industries, resulting in PCDD/PCDF containing residues and releases.

For example, pulp and paper sludge from bleach process using elemental chlorine have been highly contaminated with PCDD/PCDF and other chlorinated compounds. The application of such sludges to land or through dumping of sludges resulted in hotspots or contaminated land (see example 10g). Elemental chlorine either remains in the final product (e.g. HCl, NaOCl, ClO , phosphorous chlorides 2 or metal chlorides) or is simply used in the process (e.g. titanium dioxide, magnesium or silicon) (Stringer and Johnston 2001). For some of these processes, high PCDD/PCDF formation and release potential has been documented. Contaminated sites have been assessed worldwide, e.g. magnesium production in Norway which polluted several fjords and associated food webs with an estimated total PCDD/PCDF release between 50 and 100 kg TEQ (Knutzen and Oehme 1989). The production of titanium dioxide using chlorine process can also generate PCDD/PCDF in the order of kg/year (Wenborn et al. 1999). 147",

In particular, non‐BAT incinerators that process organochlorine products, especially PCDD/PCDF precursors (PCB, chlorophenols, chlorobenzenes and other chlorinated aromatics), can result in high emissions of PCDD/PCDFs with considerable impacts on the local environment (Holmes et al. 1994, 1998). Only a limited number of cases of PCDD/PCDF contaminated sites from waste incinerators have been documented to date, showing that release vectors from incinerators ‐ air, solids and water ‐ can lead to PCDD/PCDF contaminated sites if not appropriately managed and controlled (see example 10h). The areas around incinerators can also be contaminated from spills of hazardous chemicals treated/destroyed in these facilities. For the inventory of PCDD/PCDF contaminated sites from incinerators (and other thermal facilities), (former) management practices and disposal of ashes (in particular fly ash and APC residues) and water release from wet scrubbers18 should be assessed. Contaminated sites via deposition from air releases are only expected for non‐BAT incinerators which emit high PCDD/PCDF levels over extended time periods. In addition to soil measurements, PCDD/PCDF levels in eggs or cow’s milk in the vicinity of the incinerator are potentially good indicators of the contamination status. 10i Metal Industries A limited number of PCDD/PCDF contaminated sites associated with metal industries have been documented. Typically, toxic heavy metals represent the key contaminants for sites associated with these industries, while PCDD/PCDF are generally regarded as minor by‐products.

Releases from primary metal production processes can cause PCDD/PCDF contaminated sites via distribution of metal industry slag, as recorded in Germany. In this case, more than 400,000 tons of slag from a specific primary copper production process, which was highly contaminated with PCDD/PCDF (10,000 to 100,000 ng TEQ/kg), was used as a surface cover for more than 1,000 sports fields, playgrounds and pavements in Germany and neighbouring countries (Ballschmiter and Bacher 1996, Theisen et al. 1993). PCDD/PCDF contaminated sites around a sinter plant in Italy have also resulted in restrictions on grazing (Diletti et al. 2009). Emissions from a secondary copper smelter in Rastatt/Germany contaminated surrounding soils, including residential areas, with PCDD/PCDF levels above the German limit values for contaminated soils (Hagenmaier et al. 1992). For the inventory of PCDD/PCDF (and heavy metal) hotspots and contaminated sites, the air releases over years/decades should be considered as well as the management and disposal of ashes. 10j Fire Accidents Fires can produce soot and residues with elevated concentrations of PCDD/PCDF (see also category 6b). High levels of contamination result from fires where chlorinated aromatic compounds are burned such as PCB transformer fires or fires of pesticide stocks or other organochlorine stockpiles. 18 According to BAT, wet scrubbers operate in closed cycles with phase out of the salt and appropriate deposition. 148",

The soot should thus be collected and disposed of properly as hazardous waste. 10k Dredging of Sediments and Contaminated Flood Plains Sediments from harbours or downstream of industrial discharge pipelines from any of the above‐ listed industrial activities can be contaminated with PCDD/PCDF, HCB and other pollutants like heavy metals. Very often, to maintain access through channels, these sediments are dredged and deposited on land. This activity only removes PCDD/PCDF contamination from its location and from the aquatic environment, and transfers the same level of contamination to another location with potentially new exposures. When inventories of dredging activities are established, the deposition of sediments on areas used for agriculture and residential housing should be highlighted and possibly assessed for levels of contamination. Rivers with a history of PCDD/PCDF contamination can have PCDD/PCDF contaminated floodplains in addition to polluted sediments. Since floodplains are often used for grazing or in agriculture, the inventory and management of impacted floodplains should be performed to prevent human exposure (see example 10k). 10l Dumps of Wastes/Residues from Source Groups 1­9 Where PCDD/PCDF containing products or residues have been disposed of, there is a probability that these contaminants will be released into the environment. PCDD/PCDF are relatively immobile in dumps or landfills as long as there are no organic co‐deposits facilitating leaching or seepage water capable of mobilizing the contamination. Of particular importance is the remobilization of PCDD/PCDF‐containing deposits if such landfills or dumps are excavated due to remediation measures or for mining purposes (see category 9a; see example 10l). Chemical or otherwise hazardous landfills containing PCDD/PCDF are sometimes secured by engineering measures. Because of their persistence, PCDD/PCDF and other unintentional POPs will persist in landfills for many decades or centuries (Balzer et al. 2008).

Landfills and deposits should thus be inventoried and included in a database. In a systematic inventory of landfills/dumps within a country, the specific presence of PCDD/PCDF and other unintentional POPs should be included. 10m Kaolin or Ball Clay Sites Ball clay and kaolinic clays in different regions in the world can contain PCDD/PCDF with a specific OCDD dominated pattern (Ferrario et al. 2007, Horii et al. 2011). A first global inventory has been established by Horii et al. (2011). Typical for all samples is the almost total absence of PCDF, and the nearly identical congener/isomer distribution throughout all geographies. Thus, PCDD appear to have been formed by natural processes possibly millions of years ago (Ferrario et al. 2007, Horii et al. 2011). Kaolin samples from Africa have also been found to contain elevated levels of PCDD (Hogenboom et al. 2011). Studies also show that the relative high levels of PCDD/PCDF in human milk samples from Congo and Ivory Coast are due to the use of the clay during pregnancy (see example 149",

The TEQ is an estimate of the total 2,3,7,8‐Cl DD (or 4 TCDD)–like activity of the mixture. Although the scientific basis cannot be considered as solid, the TEF approach has been adopted as an administrative tool by many agencies and allows converting quantitative analytical data for individual PCDD/PCDF congeners into a single toxic equivalent (TEQ). As TEFs are interim values and administrative tools, they are based on present state of knowledge and should be revised, as new data becomes available. Concurrent with the development of the TEF and TEQ approach for intake situations (humans, fish, birds) has been its application to environmental matrices such as soil, sediment, industrial wastes, soot, fly ash from municipal incinerators, waste water effluents, etc. As such, the TEF approach has been and continues to be used to give a single value to complex environmental matrices.

      "text": "Toolkit for Identification and Quantification of Releases of Dioxins, Furans and Other Unintentional POPs January 2013 Annex 2 Guidance on Identifying Sources of PCDD/PCDF More than 80 PCDD/PCDF sources, each with one or more emission factors, are currently listed in the Toolkit. However, new, yet unlisted sources continue to be identified. These sources attest to the variety of materials and conditions that are associated with PCDD/PCDF formation and release. A brief description of the factors that influence PCDD/PCDF formation and release during industrial chemical production and in combustion processes is given in Chapter 1.4 and further addressed in the BAT/BEP Guidelines. While carbon, hydrogen and oxygen are common to most industrial chemical production processes as well as processes and activities involving combustion, the possibility of PCDD/PCDF formation exists only when chlorine is also present in elemental, organic or inorganic form. This distinguishing characteristic has been used in identifying some of the PCDD/PCDF sources now listed in the Toolkit. For example, Denmark began the process of identifying PCDD/PCDF sources within its chemical manufacturing sector by selecting and then further evaluating processes that involved any form of chlorine (Hansen 2000). In Germany, a similar strategy was followed in identifying PCDD/PCDF sources among industries in North Rhine‐Westphalia (Broker et al. 1999) and among thermal processes in the European Union (Wenborn et al. 1999). This same strategy can be used to identify new, as‐yet unlisted sources as well as hotspots. PCDD/PCDF source identification can be further refined by the preliminary evaluation shown below, which entails drawing on information in national and regional inventories, national chemical lists, the scientific literature and reports by governments and non‐governmental organizations. More in‐depth evaluation may also entail assessing the availability of other materials, such as metal catalysts, and conditions, such as temperatures, that are conducive to PCDD/PCDF formation (see, for example, Chapter 1.4, and the BAT/BEP Guidelines, Section VI.F Specific Chemical Production Processes Releasing Chemicals Listed in Annex C) and monitoring gaseous emissions, aqueous discharges, solid residues and products of suspected PCDD/PCDF sources.

For example, a recent study found PCDD/PCDF as contaminants in 23 pesticides currently used in Australia and estimated that applications of only one of the pesticides, pentachloronitrobenzene (PCNB), may be Australia’s largest single PCDD/PCDF source (Holt et al. 2010). In addition, preliminary results suggest that post‐ application photodegradation of PCNB may increase PCDD/PCDF releases by 3 to 4 times (Holt et al. 2009). Production of each of the pesticides in this study is a potential PCDD/PCDF source and, as such, deserves careful attention. It is also useful to note that many other chemicals and pesticides were identified in the past as known, suspected or highly probable PCDD/PCDF sources and some of these are still in production today (see Bejarano 2004). 153",

      "text": "Toolkit for Identification and Quantification of Releases of Dioxins, Furans and Other Unintentional POPs January 2013 Annex 3 Questionnaires This annex presents sample questionnaires, which can be used to collect information necessary to compile national inventories. It is particularly practical and appropriate to use individual plant questionnaires to gather information on large point sources19. This includes information needed for classification of plants, selection of the appropriate emission factors, and the associated activity rates to calculate emissions. Since the return rate of the questionnaires is likely to be low, incomplete information‐data gaps‐ will need to be covered by making assumptions about certain source groups, where no specific information can be collected. Approaches will vary, but all assumptions should be clearly described in order to facilitate inventory updates in the following years or revisions in light of improved information. To determine complete activity rates, a combination of questionnaires (for large point sources) and national statistics should be used. Sample questionnaires are provided also to facilitate data gathering for entire source groups such as transport or open burning. These questionnaires may be used to assist in the data collection process, but they will most likely need to be complemented by additional information sources. Questionnaires should be accompanied by a cover letter explaining the purpose and context of data gathering, as well as the contact information, reference year, and return date for the questionnaire. 19 Large point sources include major industrial emitters, and the collection of information on their activity rates should be given priority. Definition of the large point sources as described for different industrial sectors in Annex 1 of the Directive 2008/1/EC on Integrated Pollution Prevention and Control (IPPC) may be used for orientation. As an example, emission from the following large point sources are regulated by the IPPC directive: • combustion installations with a rated thermal input exceeding 50 MW; • installations for the production of iron or steel with a capacity exceeding 2,5 tons per hour; • installations for the production of cement with a capacity exceeding 500 tons per day, etc. More details can be found at http://eur‐ lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32008L0001:EN:NOT 161",

      "text": "Toolkit for Identification and Quantification of Releases of Dioxins, Furans and Other Unintentional POPs January 2013 Annex 4 Compilation of all emission factors This annex contains a compilation of all emission factors for the ten source categories. These sheets are also available as EXCEL files to be used directly for calculation of the annual releases via all vectors. In the following tables, the majority of the emission factors are given as μg TEQ per ton of feed material or product, respectively. In a few exemptions, e.g., residues from coal fired stoves in domestic heating (category 3e) as well as for water releases in group 9, the annual releases are estimated on basis of residues generated. For other estimates, e.g., water and residue releases from the pulp and paper industry, the preferred option may also be to calculate the annual releases based on volume discharged and concentration in the water or residue, respectively. Care should also be taken that annual releases are not counted twice; e.g. the residue from one process may be feed material for another process or activity. Examples are ashes from the ferrous and non‐ferrous metal industry, which may be utilized in secondary processes. Further, wastewater from industrial processes normally should be accounted to the respective industry where they are generated. However, occasionally, statistics may provide data at the disposal site, for example the amount of wastewater discharged at a specific location may be known; e.g. for open water dumping or discharges at sewer plants. Thus, special care should be taken when numbers are being filled in, especially for group 9. In the following tables: “NA” denotes that the vector is not expected. “ND” denotes that presently there is no suitable emission factor available. This means that this vector can be of importance but presently, releases along this vector cannot be calculated. “LoC”denotes the level of confidence assigned to a specific emission factor. “H” denotes a high level of confidence. “M” denotes a medium level of confidence. “L”denotes a low level of confidence. 176",

These source categories are also among those considered in the Toolkit, where they are placed into ten source groups to facilitate elaboration and reporting of POPs releases. The standard format for reporting PCDD/PCDF releases through national reports under Article 15 is given in table III.5.1 below. Some countries also report POPs releases to air and a number of other pollutants under the UNECE Convention on Long‐Range Transboundary Air Pollution (CLRTAP). For these countries, the correspondence between source categorization under CLRTAP, according to the Guidelines for Reporting Emission Data under the Convention on Long‐Range Transboundary Air Pollution (ECE/EB.AIR/2008/4) and the source categories of the Stockholm Convention is presented in table III.5.2 below. Under the CLRTAP guidelines, sources are categorized according to the Common Reporting Format (CFR), which is a standardized format for reporting national emissions under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and CLRTAP. Within the CFR a standardized Nomenclature for Reporting (NFR) lists and classifies a number of source categories and sub‐sectors by codes.

The following definitions apply: m³ Cubic meter: is the SI unit of volume and may be used to express the volume of any substance, whether solid, liquid, or gas. Nm³ Normal cubic meter: refers to the volume of any gas at 0°C and 1 atm (101.325 kPa). In European countries and for emissions from municipal waste incinerators (also co‐combustion of waste): Nm³ is defined at the following conditions: 101.325 kPa (= 1 atm), 273.15 K, dry gas, and 11% oxygen. For emissions from other types of combustion/thermal plants, there is no requirement to normalize to 11% oxygen. Rm³ in Canada: Reference cubic meter. When using R, the conditions are 25°C, 1 atm, dry. The need for oxygen correction should be explicitly stated, although it sometimes is not. The Canada‐wide standard utilizes are correction to 11% oxygen for incinerators and coastal pulp and paper mill boilers burning salt‐laden wood residue. For others sectors such as sinter plants, they have decided to use no oxygen correction. Sm³ in U.S.A.: Is the dry standard cubic meter (represented as dscm) at 1 atmosphere of pressure and 20 degrees Celsius (68 degrees Farenheit). The contaminant concentration is corrected to some standard percent oxygen or carbon dioxide in the combustion gases, usually 7% oxygen and 12% carbon dioxide. 201",

Through its structure for reporting, i.e., ten source categories and five release vectors, it is possible to gain further insight into the global situation as to the sources of PCDD/PCDF releases.

      "text": "Toolkit for Identification and Quantification of Releases of Dioxins, Furans and Other Unintentional POPs January 2013 Annex 8 Data quality Because there is some level of uncertainty in all data, compiling inventories always entails uncertainty. There is uncertainty associated with data on both activity rates (e.g. reliability of data sources and data collection procedure) and emission factors (e.g. quality of measurement data). This is not a problem, since the purpose of the inventories is to assess the national situation by identifying sources and estimating releases of particular pollutants, setting priorities, developing an action plan to minimize these releases, and evaluating the progress achieved by assessing the trends observed over time. If the same methodology is consistently being applied when reassessing the country’s situation regarding PCDD/PCDF emission, then this purpose can be met. The following sources of uncertainty may be considered when developing a national PCDD/PCDF inventory: Default emission factors: Two questions need to be answered when assessing emission factor quality: (cid:131) How reliable are the data that were used to derive the emission factor? and (cid:131) How well does the emission factor represent the emission source under different national circumstances, i.e. can it be appropriately used as a global average emission factor for a specific source activity? Evaluation of the quality of emission factors included or to be included in the Toolkit is the mandate of the Toolkit experts, who should ascertain that only scientifically‐sound data are included into the Toolkit. Data quality ratings are assigned by the Toolkit experts to all emission factors published in the Toolkit. Classifying sources: There is uncertainty in classifying sources and, consequently, selecting appropriate emission factors from the Toolkit while developing the national inventory. Activity rates: There is uncertainty in generating activity data for inventory compilation. The overall level of uncertainty in the complete inventory is a combination of the above three elements. The most complete guidance document currently available is the IPCC Good Practice Guidance and Uncertainty Management in National Greenhouse Gas Inventories. However, this document was developed with a different purpose, and is not suitable for developing PCDD/PCDF emission inventories under the Stockholm Convention. For the purpose of emission inventories under the Stockholm Convention, a simple approach using qualitative data quality rating is recommended. An emission factor's rating is a general indication of the reliability, or robustness, of that factor. This rating is assigned based on the estimated reliability of the experiments used to develop the factor and on both the amount and the representative characteristics of those data. This approach",

Publications/reports, reviewed by the Toolkit expert group will equally be considered as peer‐reviewed. (cid:131) Data range: High variability of available data may trigger the use of median emission factors that do not fully reflect certain operational circumstances. A wide range of the data used to derive an emission factor would therefore reduce the confidence in applying the respective emission factor to a concrete situation. (cid:131) Geographical coverage: Experimental data with low variability derived at many locations over the world would increase the confidence in using the respective emission factor in different national circumstances. (cid:131) Need for extrapolation: The need for extrapolation/expert judgment in order to fill data gaps reduces the confidence in the emission factors derived by making certain assumptions e.g. based on information from similar classes. (cid:131) Process stability: High stability of the process generating PCDD/PCDF generally increases the confidence in the experimental results used to derive emission factors. It should be noted that high variability of emission data may be obtained even with a stable process. High confidence levels are to be assigned to emission factors derived from data with well‐described variability. Taking into account the criteria described above, each emission factor is assigned a data quality rating according to the following definitions: Rating of emission factors Qualifier/Level of confidence Criteria High Peer review Low data range Broad geographical coverage Assumptions and/or expert judgment are not required High stability of the process Medium Any combination of high and low criteria Low No peer review Wide data range Limited geographical coverage Extrapolation is needed e.g. EF derived from similar class Low stability of the process The studies used to derive the Toolkit’s emission factors are made accessible for the users whenever possible, to ensure that emission factors are applied with the specified level of confidence only when 210\n\nQualifier/Level of confidence | Criteria ---------------------------------------- High | Peer review Low data range Broad geographical coverage Assumptions and/or expert judgment are not required High stability of the process Medium | Any combination of high and low criteria Low | No peer review Wide data range Limited geographical coverage Extrapolation is needed e.g. EF derived from similar class Low stability of the process",

Ratings can be similarly assigned to the activity or production data, taking into account the reliability of the data source, data collection process, number of data points (e.g. for questionnaires) etc. According to these criteria, activity data taken from national statistics, or derived from questionnaires with a high return rate may be used with high confidence. Activity data based on assumptions about certain sources (especially with respect to technologies in place), where specific information could not be collected, will be assigned a low level of confidence.

Additional guidance has been introduced on classifying sources within this category, estimating activity rates, and on data quality aspects. Derivation of emission factors Release to Air For class 1, the default emission factor of 3,500 µg TEQ/t of waste burned was derived from a flue gas flow rate of about 10,000 Nm³/t MSW and a concentration of 350 ng TEQ/Nm³ (at 11% O ). Emission 2 factors of 3,230 µg TEQ/t have been reported from Switzerland and 5,000 µg TEQ/t from the Netherlands (LUA 1997). For class 2, it is assumed that the specific flue gas volume is 7,000 Nm³/t MSW, due to better combustion controls and lower excess air and the PCDD/PCDF concentration is reduced to 50 ng TEQ/Nm³ (at 11% O ). Plants of this type may be equipped with an ESP, multi‐cyclone and/or a simple 2 scrubber. In class 3, the combustion efficiency and the efficiency of APC systems are further improved (e.g., ESP and multiple scrubbers, spray‐dryer and baghouse or similar combinations) so that the PCDD/PCDF concentration is reduced to about 5 ng TEQ/Nm³ (at 11% O ). Also, the specific flue gas volume is 2 reduced to 6,000 Nm³/t MSW. Class 4 incinerators are the current state‐of‐the‐art in MSW incineration and are equipped with advanced APC technology (e.g., activated carbon adsorption units or SCR/DeDiox). Thus, only 5,000 Nm³/t MSW and a concentration of less than 0.1 ng TEQ/Nm³ (at 11% O ) will be the norm (LUA 1997, 2 IFEU 1998).

Release to Water Releases to water may occur when wet scrubbers are employed for the removal of particulate matter or to cool down ashes. In such cases, the amount of PCDD/PCDF released through this vector, can best be estimated using the default emission factors given for residue. Normally, concentrations are in the range of a few pg TEQ/L and the highest PCDD/PCDF concentration reported in a scrubber effluent before removal of particulate matter was below 200 pg TEQ/L. Most of PCDD/PCDF are associated with the particulate matter and are consequently captured in the filter cake or sludge from treatment of the scrubber effluent. For inventorying purposes, these scrubber water treatment residues are included with fly ash. Release to Land No release to land is expected unless untreated residue is directly placed onto or mixed with soil. The concentration released in such cases will be covered under “Release in Residues”. Release in Products The process has no product, thus there will be no emission factor. Release in Residues PCDD/PCDF concentrations in fly ash are substantial, while the total mass generated per ton of MSW is typically around 4‐9%. PCDD/PCDF concentrations in the bottom ash are rather low, however, the amount of bottom ash generated per ton of MSW is around 19‐30% (UNEP 2011b). Fly ash and bottom ash also contain unburned carbon from 1% (class 4) up to 30% (class 1). Since unburned carbon in the ash greatly enhances the formation and adsorption of PCDD/PCDF, the concentration is greatest in class 1; here, 500 ng TEQ/kg was chosen for bottom ash. This value has been extrapolated; it is about 10‐fold above the average measured concentrations from European plants in the 1980s. In class 2 the concentration is assumed to be 30,000 ng TEQ/kg in fly ash and 100 ng TEQ/kg in bottom ash due to greatly improved combustion efficiency resulting in a much lower LOI of the ash.

No data exist for classes 1 and 2 for bottom ash concentrations. Also, the removal efficiency of particulate matter increases with the quality of the plant.

Additional guidance has been introduced on classifying sources within this category, estimating activity rates, and on data quality aspects. Derivation of emission factors Release to Air In modern facilities, biomass is burned in either stationary or circulating fluidized bed furnaces where the formation of PCDD/PCDF is limited due to good combustion conditions. Such plants would likely have effective pollution control systems, especially removal of particulate matter, which is critical for the operation of circulating fluidized bed furnaces. Other furnace types commonly used are vertical rotary stage or open hearth‐type furnaces, grate‐type furnaces or muffle‐type furnaces. The default emission factors for all three categories were determined based on reported emission concentrations between 130 µg TEQ/t (Belgian study) and 1 µg TEQ/t (Canadian and Swedish studies). Thus, for class 1 a default emission factor of 100 µg TEQ/t was chosen for those old uncontrolled facilities. Class 2 represents better controlled newer facilities. A default emission factor of 10 µg TEQ/t was assigned to this class. Finally, class 3 with a selected default emission factor of 1 µg TEQ/t includes all the modern facilities for waste wood and biomass combustion (LUA 1997, IFEU 1998, Environment Canada 1999).

Release to Land No release to land is expected unless untreated residue is directly placed onto or mixed with soil. The concentration released in such cases will be covered under “Release in Residues”. Release in Products The process has no product; thus there will be no emission factor. Release in Residues PCDD/PCDF concentration in the ash will be high since the ash usually contains rather high concentrations of unburned carbon. Especially in older furnaces, higher gaseous emissions clearly indicate lower combustion efficiency resulting in higher concentrations of unburned carbon in the fly ash.

For class 2, a medium value was chosen due to lack of data (LUA 1997, IFEU 1998, Environment Canada 1999). In class 1, no APC equipment is used and consequently no fly ash is collected but rather most of it is emitted to the atmosphere with the flue gas. Even though no specific collection device for fly ash is installed and the majority of the fly ash is discharged through the stack, some fly ash is expected to be collected in the furnace and the ductwork leading to the stack as well as in the stack itself.

This survey resulted in the identification of possible new/revised emission factors for PCDD/PCDF and possible new emission factors for PCBs and HCB. The assessment of recent scientific findings led to new proposals regarding emission factors for PCDD/PCDF releases, along with the revision of class definition and description. Changes to emission factors were made where significant differences were found between factors derived from recent scientific literature and those included in the Toolkit. In many instances, the literature review also enhanced the level of confidence associated with current dioxin emission factors. The majority of PCDD/PCDF emission factors for source category 2a Iron Ore Sintering were confirmed; in the case of residues in classes 2 and 3, higher emission factors were proposed.

Derivation of emission factors Release to Air Iron ore sinter plants have been identified as a major source of PCDD/PCDF to air in some countries. The highest emissions are expected from plants which have not made comprehensive attempts to reduce PCDD/PCDF emissions and use waste materials such as cutting oils, dust from the ESP, etc (class 1). The emission factor for this class – 20 μg TEQ/t – comes from two inventory studies using a gas volume of 2,000 Nm³ per ton of sinter and a concentration of 10 ng TEQ/Nm³ (HMIP 1995, SCEP 1994). At one plant in Germany, an emission factor of nearly 100 μg TEQ/t sinter has been determined; respective stack emissions were 43 ng TEQ/m³ (LUA 1997). This emission factor was confirmed through the highest value observed in the European Union after the year 2000 which is 16 µg TEQ/t (BREF 2012). For plants with low waste use, the class 2 emission factor is 5 μg TEQ/t based on studies from Belgium, Sweden, the Netherlands, and Germany (LUA 1997). This emission factor was confirmed by several publications. In the 2011 version of the iron and steel BREF (BREF 2012), the majority of values ranges from 2 to 6 µg TEQ/t (more than 12 plants). The CORINAIR database considers an emission factor of 1.8 µg TEQ/t where ESPs are used. Between 2002 and 2004, measurements have been achieved on three sinter plants using ESPs in the UK showing emission factors with a mean value of 2.2 µg TEQ/t (Aries et al. 2006). For highest technology plants, where PCDD/PCDF emissions were addressed and major changes to technology and plant operation were realized, a class 3 emission factor of 0.3 µg TEQ/t is proposed.

For highest technology plants, where PCDD/PCDF emissions were addressed and major changes to technology and plant operation were realized, a class 3 emission factor of 0.3 µg TEQ/t is proposed. Improvements may include measures to reduce gas flows and multistage scrubbing with effluent treatment. The emission factor of 0.3 μg TEQ/t is based on a reduced gas flow of 1,500 Nm³/t and a concentration of 0.2 ng TEQ/Nm³ (Smit et al. 1999, HMIP 1995). This emission factor is confirmed by the lowest emission factor (0.15 µg TEQ/t) observed in the European Union, during the data collection process which was achieved for the iron and steel BREF (BREF 2012). Data collected in Taiwan from 4 plants show emission factors ranging from 0.18 to 0.89 µg TEQ/t (Wang et al. 2009) whereas data collected in Japan provide a mean value of 0.27 µg TEQ/t (Iwata et al. 2008). Concentration measured in one Korean sinter plant was 0.45 ng TEQ/Nm3 (Kim et al. 2005), which corresponds to an emission factor of 0.9 µg TEQ/t (assuming a gas flow of 2,000 Nm3/t of sinter). Where wet scrubbers are used in conjunction with an ESP, the mean PCDD/PCDF concentration from 9 measurements is 0.31 ng TEQ/Nm3 (Guerriero et al. 2006), which, assuming a gas flow of 2,000 Nm3/t, corresponds to an emission factor of 0.62 µgTEQ/t. Air emission data related to PCBs and HCB have also been identified in the literature. The European BREF document gives a PCB emission factor range of 0.025 to 0.18 µg TEQ/t (BREF 2012). Measurements carried out in Korea showed PCB concentrations of 0.018 ng TEQ/Nm3 (Kim et al. 2005).

According to these references, the PCB share in the total TEQ is ranging from 4 to 9%. Therefore, an emission factor of 1 µg TEQ/t is proposed for class 1. HCB data are provided by three references. Two Japanese studies have synthesized HCB measurement results and propose emission factors of 430 µg/t and 150 µg/t respectively (Ota et al. 2005, Sakai et al. 2009). Measurements were also carried out in Poland and HCB emission factors could be derived. Those are ranging from 640 to 1,730 µg/t (Grochowalski et al. 2007). Assuming that class 3 APC devices are the most efficient for HCB removal and that class 1 and 2 APC devices have similar removal efficiencies towards HCB emissions, an emission factor of 300 µg/t is proposed for class 3 and an emission factor of 1,000 µg/t for class 2 and class 1. Release to Water A release to water may occur if there is a wet scrubber used in the process with an effluent discharge. No emission factor could be developed for this release route. Any liquid discharge should be noted, along with its quantity and any treatment. Release to Land No release to land is expected. Dumping of residues to land should be noted. Release in Products The product of this process is sinter, which is fed to the blast furnace. PCDD/PCDF present in the sinter will enter the blast furnace and are likely to be destroyed. Therefore no release in product can be assessed. Release in Residues The main residue is expected to be in the form of dust collected in dust control devices. Some of it may be recycled to the process, or may be removed from the process as a waste. As de‐dusting devices are more sophisticated in the case of classes 2 and 3, the corresponding emission factors should be higher than class 1. Class 1 emission factor is derived from measurements carried out before 2005 when de‐dusting systems were far from BAT.

UK data on the amounts of PCDD/PCDF in dust from sinter plant ESPs give a range from 29 to 90 ng I‐TEQ/kg. Only a small amount of sinter dust is disposed of (e.g., in the UK, 700 t/a from a sinter production of 15.1 million tons of sinter – about 0.05 kg dust per ton of sinter). Data from Germany measured in 1993/94 were in the range of 196 to 488 ng I‐TEQ/kg (EC 1999a). An emission factor of 0.003 is therefore proposed for class 1. The iron and steel BREF developed within the EU gives an emission factor range for residues ranging from 0.14 to 3.21 µg TEQ/t (BREF 2012). Besides, measurements carried out in Korea in 2008 gave emission factors ranging from 0.14 to 3.21 µg TEQ/t (Jin et al. 2009).

Emission factors from the 2005 version of the Toolkit were derived from a single publication which was released in 1994 (Bremmer et al. 1994). Two publications from 2009 helped reviewing those emission factors. These publications provide data from plants in Taiwan and China (Wang et al. 2009, Liu et al. 2009).

Derivation of emission factors Release to Air I. Iron and steel making PCDD/PCDF will be released into gases from furnaces. It can be difficult to capture all the gases from the process, and a large fraction of the gas and PCDD/PCDF may be present in fugitive emissions rather than in stack gases. Emissions seem to increase greatly by poor quality mixed scrap feeds, in particular where metal working residues, including cutting oils, are fed. The preheating of scrap to improve energy efficiency can lead to increased emissions as well; concentrations up to 9.2 ng TEQ/Nm³ have been measured (Germany, LUA 1997). In Europe, PCDD/PCDF measurements gave emission factors that ranged 0.07‐9 μg I‐TEQ/t LS (liquid steel); based on European data, a conversion factor of 940 kg pig iron/t LS was used. Regarding blast furnaces (class 4), flue gas volumes from hot stoves are between 100,000 and 600,000 Nm³/h per blast furnace.

Such data are confirmed by more recent measurements from the European Union, as the iron and steel BREF document reports an emission factor of 0.003 µg TEQ/t (BREF 2012).

Polish data (Grochowalski et al. 2006) are consistent with this figure as an emission factor of 0.02 µg TEQ/t was derived from measurement at a plant scale. As emission factors of BOF are similar to those of class 3 EAF (see below), BOF are incorporated in class 3. For electric arc furnaces, most measured emission data relate to plants using relatively clean scrap and virgin iron and which are fitted with some after‐burners and fabric filters for gas cleaning. Emission factors derived from plants in Sweden, Germany, and Denmark gave emission factors between 0.07 and 9 μg I‐TEQ/t LS. For the Toolkit, an emission factor of 3 μg TEQ/t LS is applied (class 2) (Bremmer et al. 1994, SCEP 1994, Napier 1998). This emission factor is supported by data from several publications issued between 2003 and 2009. For instance, the following emission factors were derived: 1.33‐7.6 µg TEQ/t in Taiwan (Wang et al. 2009), 1.7 µg TEQ/t in Japan (Sakai et al. 2009), 4.8 µg TEQ/t in Italy (ENEA 2003). Emissions from EAF plants using dirty scrap containing cutting oils or plastic materials as well as plants with scrap preheating and relatively poor controls were found to have higher concentrations of PCDD/PCDF in stack gases as found in Germany (SCEP 1994). In such cases, an emission factor of 10 μg TEQ/t LS is used (poor plants could emit more) for class 1. This emission factor is supported by data from many publications issued between 2004 and 2009. For instance, the following emission factors were derived: 6.3 µg TEQ/t in Taiwan (Hwang et al. 2006), 11‐90 µg TEQ/t in Sweden (Oberg 2004).

Where careful controls are placed on the scrap used (excluding cutting oils and heavily contaminated scrap) and efficient gas cleaning is used with secondary combustion and fabric filters (sometimes in combination with a rapid water quench) emissions below 0.1 ng TEQ/Nm³ can be achieved. For these plants an emission factor of 0.1 μg TEQ/t should be used (class 3). The same low concentrations were measured in the flue gases from basic oxygen furnaces; e.g. a median concentration of 0.028 ng I‐ TEQ/Nm³ (LUA 1997). This emission factor is supported by data from many publications issued between 2003 and 2010. For instance, the following emission factors were derived: 0.3‐0.92 µg TEQ/t in New Zealand (Merz 2004, Graham and Bingham 2010), 0.03 µg TEQ/t in Sweden (Oberg 2004), 0.26 µg TEQ/t in Italy (ENEA 2003). Regarding PCBs, based on results got on industrial sites from Poland (Grochowalski et al. 2006), an emission factor of 0.001 µg TEQ/t is proposed for classes 3 and 4. Regarding HCB, Japan measurements on EAFs have been published for the last years in several publications (Ota et al. 2005, Sakai et al. 2009). EAF emission factors range between 2,100 and 2,900 µg/t. As a consequence, the same emission factor is proposed for EAFs related to classes 1 to 3. Measurements at a BOF and a blast furnace in Poland correspond to an emission factor of 2 µg/t and 1 µg/t respectively (Grochowalski et al. 2006). II.

Cold air cupolas showed higher emissions and a factor of 1 μg TEQ/t is used for plants with fabric filters, (class 3). This initial emission factor has been confirmed by recent Chinese measurements (Lv et al. 2011a). Limited testing on rotary drum furnaces showed higher levels again and a factor of 4.3 μg TEQ/t is applied to plants with fabric filters for gas cleaning (class 2). Where cold air cupolas or rotary drum furnaces are used which do not have fabric filters or equivalent for gas cleaning a higher emission factor of 10 μg TEQ/t should be used (class 1). If poor quality scrap (high contamination) or poorly controlled furnaces with gas cleaning other than effective fabric filters is found this should be noted. Regarding PCBs, new data have been published since 2005. A Chinese team (Lv et al. 2011a) reported an emission factor of 0.5 µg TEQ/t for cold air cupolas (class 3) while a South Korean team (Yu et al. 2006) reported an emission factor range of 0.01‐0.03 µg TEQ/t for hot air cupolas (class 4). As class 2 and 3 emission factors for PCDD/PCDFs are very similar, it is proposed to use the same PCB emission factor for theses two classes. III. Hot‐dip galvanizing plants For hot‐dip galvanizing plants, as for any other thermal plant, the presence or absence of flue gas cleaning equipment, will be a determining factor as to the magnitude of the PCDD/PCDF air emissions. Some plants do not have flue gas cleaning devices, others have bagfilters.

The Danish inventory utilized the German data and a stack volume of 33,000 Nm³ emitted per ton of iron/steel galvanized to estimate its national emissions. A Spanish study (Fabrellas et al. 2003), investigated hot‐dip galvanizing plants equipped with bagfilters. The concentrations – 0.003‐0.014 ng I‐TEQ/Nm³ ‐ were much lower than those reported by Germany (LUA 1997).

Release in Products No significant release is expected with the product steel from this process, it has been subject to high temperatures and PCDD/PCDF is likely to have been driven off or destroyed. Release in Residues The principal residues of interest are slag and dust collected in flue gas treatment systems. Other dust deposited from fugitive emissions may also contain PCDD/PCDF. I. Iron and steel making From blast furnaces, 9‐15 kg of dust and sludge per ton of LS are generated from the gas purification system. 280 kg of slag are produced per ton of LS. In BOF steel making, 12‐27 kg of dusts and slags are generated per ton of LS from BOF gas treatment. Converter slag is 99 kg per ton of LS. Electric arc furnaces produce more slags, e.g. 129 kg/t LS for carbon steels and 161 kg/t LS for high alloyed and stainless steels. An average emission factor for PCDD/PCDF in residues can only be given for EAFs: from gas cleaning operations (fabric filter) an emission factor of 15 μg TEQ/t is based on an average of UK data (Dyke et al. 1997). This factor assumes similar gas cleaning equipment; the release may be different with other systems. This factor is used for the poorly controlled and average plants (classes 1 and 2). Such emission factor has been confirmed by recent publications. The following emission factors have been derived recently: 22 µg TEQ/t (Chang et al. 2006), 32 µg TEQ/t (Du et al. 2009). A lower emission factor of 0.15 μg TEQ/t is used for the best plants (Bremmer et al. 1994): class 3. The fate or use of the residues should be noted (PCDD/PCDF can be introduced into other processes if these residues are used as feedstock in recycling processes). II.

Slag can be generated as well as sand casting technologies will generate substantial volumes of sand, which may be reused in the plant or be sent off for use as construction material (USEPA 1998b). These emission factors have been confirmed by some recently published data from other parts of the world. For instance, measurements carried out in 14 Chinese foundries which can be allocated to classes 3 and 4 showed an average emission factor of 0.365 µg TEQ/t. First PCB data with respect to residues were published recently (Lv et al. 2011a).

The mean value for both cases is 2,000 pg TEQ:g of filter dust. Based on Spanish and Danish publications (Martinez et al. 2008, Hansen 2001), it is assumed that 1 kg of filter dust is generated by the air pollution control for each ton of galvanized steel produced.

The compilation for European plants by the IPPC Bureau reported emissions of <0.1 ng I‐TEQ/Nm³ (BREF 2009). From these data, an emission factor of 0.03 μg TEQ/t of copper/copper alloy was derived. The data do not allow for further differentiation according to technology or performance. In the cleaned gases from sulfuric acid plants, emissions between 0.01 and 0.001 ng TEQ/Nm³ have been measured (BREF 2009). The same sources report – without further specification ‐ that processes in the melt shop for the production of semis (semi‐manufactures such as alloy cast ingots, foils, sheet, strip) gave emission factors for electric furnaces of <5 μg and for shaft and rotary furnaces of <10 μg TEQ/t, respectively. Measured PCDD/PCDF results are available from Germany (Meyer‐Wulf 1996) and Sweden (LUA 1997). However, it should be noted that these plants as well as those in Canada are not “pure” primary copper smelters since they process significant amounts of recyclable materials (Copper Smelters 2004). Measured data from Germany from such a “primary” copper smelter, that uses considerable amounts of secondary materials as feed (up to 40%) in flash smelting furnaces and matte converters gave emissions between 0.0001 and 0.007 ng TEQ/Nm³ resulting in a very narrow range of emission factors from 0.002 and 0.02 μg TEQ/t of copper (LUA 1997).

The volume of the waste gas was 5,000 Nm³ per ton of copper produced. In addition, from a Swedish primary smelter that recycles considerable amounts of secondary materials, which produced 2,000 Nm³/t of waste gases, a concentration of 11 ng I‐TEQ/m³ was reported. From the results of the measurements given above, emission factors between 0.25 μg I‐TEQ/t (from German results) and 22 μg I‐TEQ/t (from Swedish results) were derived.

Globally speaking, the assessment made for the 2005 version of the Toolkit was confirmed by the literature review conducted between 2007 and 2012: • Class 1: Concentrations of 63, 199 and 246 ng TEQ/Nm3 were measured at the outlet of a furnace (before a bag filter) in Chinese plants (Hung et al. 2009). These concentrations corresponds to emission factors of 328, 1037 and 1282 µg TEQ/t respectively, based on gas flows used in another Chinese publication (Ba et al. 2009). In the draft revised BREF on the non‐ ferrous metal industry (BREF 2009), the highest European concentrations reported in installations where no APC was used reached 29.5 ng TEQ/Nm3. Assuming a gas flow of 10,000 Nm3/t, such a concentration corresponds to an emission factor of 295 µg TEQ/t. • Class 2: Data obtained in China (Ba et al. 2009) and Taiwan (Yu et al. 2006) are very similar.

In Korea, concentrations of 0.63 ng TEQ/Nm3 were measured (Kim et al. 2005), resulting in an emission factor of 6.3 µg TEQ/t, based on the assumption that the gas flow is 10,000 Nm3/t. • Class 5: Three publications directly provide emission factors (Iwata et al. 2008, Grochowalski et al. 2007, Yu et al. 2006): 0.43, 0.04 and 0.014 µg TEQ/t respectively. These data were collected from plants located in Japan, Poland and Korea. So far, there only are few data on releases of PCDD/PCDF from class 6 copper plants. The majority of information is from secondary copper plants, where occasionally high PCDD/PCDF emissions were found in the stack gases. When compiling this Toolkit, no measured data of PCDD/PCDF emissions or releases from pure primary copper smelters have been submitted nor found elsewhere. In some countries, like Chile, among others, primary copper smelters use only ores and concentrates and do not mix with secondary materials. In other countries, like Germany, Sweden, and Canada, among others, primary copper smelters receive feeds that include scrap and other recycled materials that are introduced in these “primary” copper smelters at rates between 15% and 40% (COCHILCO 2004). For the pure primary copper smelters as present, among others, in the Chilean copper foundries, the probability to form PCDD/PCDF in the production of primary copper seems to be very low or not existing. These primary foundries use clean raw materials and use either the base smelting process (with furnaces like the Teniente or the Noranda) or the flash smelting (with Outokumpu furnace).

      "text": " the production of primary copper seems to be very low or not existing. These primary foundries use clean raw materials and use either the base smelting process (with furnaces like the Teniente or the Noranda) or the flash smelting (with Outokumpu furnace). The white copper or concentrates from the furnaces are converted into copper blister in an oxygen‐rich atmosphere by utilizing the Peirce‐Smith Converter. Typical temperatures in the smelting processes are well above the critical temperatures reported for PCDD/PCDF formation: in the Teniente, the gases are at 1,260°C in a sulphur dioxide‐rich atmosphere (at 25%), the liquid white copper at 1,240°C, and the liquid slags the temperature is 1,240°C. In the Outokumpu flash furnace the temperature is around 1,260°C and the gases leave at 1,300°C‐1,350°C. The Pierce‐Smith Converter operates in a temperature range of 1,150°C‐ 1,250°C. The refining of the copper blister – to remove sulphur and oxygen ‐ takes place in rotary kilns at an operational temperature around 1,200°C. The slags still have quite high copper contents (4%‐10%) and are treated in the Teniente furnace, electric arc furnaces, or slag flotation plants at temperatures above 1,200°C. Purification of gases originating from the smelting furnaces and the converters is done by rapid quench, followed by electrostatic precipitators and washing towers and wet scrubbers. The sulphuric acid plants (H SO plants) apply catalytic converters (COCHILCO 2004). 2 4 New data have been identified with respect to PCB air emissions. PCBs were measured at the stack of a primary copper plant corresponding to class 5 (Yu et al. 2006). On this Korean plant, a concentration of 0.08 ng TEQ/Nm3 was measured, from which an emission factor of 0.012 µg TEQ/t was derived by the authors. PCBs were also measured on three primary smelters in Poland, where concentrations were in the range of 0.0004‐0.0035 ng/Nm3. Based on PCDD/PCDF data, these concentrations would correspond to a PCB emission factor of 0.001 µg TEQ/t. Therefore, an emission factor of 0.01",

In two references, emission factors to be assigned to class 2 are calculated: 0.098 and 9.8 ng TEQ/t respectively (Ba 2009, Yu 2006). Therefore a PCB emission factor of 5 µg TEQ/t is proposed for class 2. New data have also been identified regarding HCB air emissions from primary copper production (Iwata 2008). This Japanese publication proposed an emission factor of 11,000 µg/t. This figure is assigned to class 5. Release to Water These may occur if effluents are discharged and the concentration is likely to be influenced by any water treatment applied. Any liquid release should be noted along with its source and treatment applied. One set of data is available from a Swedish plant which is one of the largest copper smelter of its kind worldwide (Jansson et al. 2009). This plant processes ores and secondary raw material such as electronic scrap. Three different effluents were sampled and analyzed, with two replicate samples collected for each effluent. The effluent consisting of purified process water and water used in the production of sulfur dioxide, mixed with cooling water showed concentrations of 3.7 to 9.1 ng TEQ/Nm3. Taking into account the effluent flow on this site, this range corresponds to an emission factor range of 0.2‐0.5 µg TEQ/t. The two other flows consist of cooling water, where emission factors are lower (1 to 20 ng TEQ/t). As this Swedish site processes a large range of feed materials, a common emission factor of 0.5 µg TEQ/t is proposed for all classes under category 2d. Release to Land No release to land is expected. Release in Products No releases to with the products are expected. Release in Residues PCDD/PCDF will be found in the solid residues from the process. The principal concern is the residues from the gas treatment equipment. Dusts and sludge collected from gas treatment may be highly enriched in PCDD/PCDF.

UK data (Dyke et al. 1997) suggests approximately 2,000 t of filter dusts arise from production of 46,000 t of copper. Combined with an average concentration of 14,400 ng TEQ/kg in the dust (SCEP 1994) this resulted in the 2005 Toolkit emission factor of 630 μg TEQ/t of product. This estimate, which was originally considered highly uncertain, has been confirmed by subsequent references from China and Korea (Ba et al. 2009, Yu et al. 2006). For high technology plants a lower emission factor of 300 μg TEQ/t was originally proposed in the 2005 Toolkit. This rough estimate has been confirmed by subsequent references. For instance, an emission factor of 116 µg TEQ/t was assessed from Korean data (Jin et al. 2009). For class 2, a PCB emission factor of 40 µg TEQ/t is proposed from two references where 4.17 µg TEQ/kg of residues and 0.13 µg TEQ/kg of residues are reported (Ba et al. 2009, Yu et al. 2006). 240",

Derivation of emission factors Release to Air Several steps in the processing of aluminum scrap can lead to the release of PCDD/PCDF to air. Thermal pretreatment of input materials, scrap melting and metal refining using chlorine or hexachloroethane (as a degasifying agent) can all lead to releases of PCDD/PCDF to air. Emissions to air vary greatly depending on the nature of the scrap, pre‐cleaning of the feed and the type of furnace and gas cleaning system applied. Older technology furnaces fitted with fabric filters had emissions of 146 to 233 μg TEQ/t of product. Concentrations and volumes of flue gas vary considerably; concentrations up to 10 ng I‐TEQ/m³ were reported (SCEP 1994). Drum furnaces using aluminum turnings seemed to produce high emissions. For systems using contaminated scrap (such as scrap with cutting oils, plastics) with simple controls and gas cleaning consisting of cyclones or basic fabric filters an emission factor of 100 μg TEQ/t of product should be used. The class 2 emission factor of 3.5 μg TEQ/t is taken from recent measurements at two European plants and are for well‐controlled modern plants with scrap treatment, fabric filters, and lime injection. The Italian study gave 5.2 μg TEQ/t of Al. Class 2 emission factor was confirmed by a number of publications released between 2005 and 2010. Emission factors of 0.3 to 8.6 µg TEQ/t were derived in Poland (Grochowalski et al. 2007), 2.9 µg TEQ/t in New Zealand (Graham and Bingham 2010), 7‐8 µg TEQ/t in Japan (Iwata et al. 2008), 1.24 µg TEQ/t in South Korea (Yu et al. 2006), 2.65 µg TEQ/t in China (Ba et al. 200",

Class 3 emission factor should be applied for plants equipped with dioxin reducing technology, especially optimized flue gas cleaning systems. Class 4 emission factors are confirmed by measurements carried out on industrial plants in New Zealand (Merz 2004) and in Italy (Pitea et al. 2008). In New Zealand, emission factors ranging from 0.0027 to 0.5 µg TEQ/t were calculated. In Italy, an emission factor of 0.35 µg TEQ/t was derived from various measurements on a plant optimized for PCDD/PCDF controls. In Taiwan, PCDD/PCDF emissions from secondary smelters fed with aluminum ingots and very clean scrap were in the range of 0.025‐0.441 µg TEQ/t, bringing additional confirmation for class 4 emission factor. Classes 4 and 5 emission factors address plants for de‐oiling and drying of Al turnings: class 4 emission factor of 5 μg TEQ/t applies to the drying of Al shavings and turnings in rotary drums or similar equipment and class 5 emission factor applied to thermal de‐oiling of turnings in rotary kilns with afterburners and fabric filters (ENEA 2003). Regarding PCB emissions, from measurements carried out in Poland (Grochowalski et al. 2007), in China (Ba et al. 2009) and in South Korea (Yu et al. 2006) on plants assigned to class 2, emission factors ranging from 0.04 to 0.81 µg TEQ/t were derived. Thus, an emission factor of 0.1 µg TEQ/t is proposed for class 3. Emission factors for class 1 are based on Japanese data (Takeuchi et al. 2009) and Spain (Sanz et al. 243",

Class 3 PCB emission factor is estimated from class 2 PCB emission factor and class 3 and class 2 PCDD/PCDF emission factors. Regarding HCB emissions, data reported in the literature and derived from Japanese plants assigned to classes 1, 2 and 3 were very similar. Class 3 emission factors were in the range of 23‐7,200 µg/t (Iwata et al. 2008). Class 2 emission factors assessed were in the range of 23‐3,600 µg/t (Ota 2005). Class 1 emission factors assessed were in the range 450‐1,300 µg/t (Takeuchi et al. 2009). Therefore, the same emission factor is proposed for classes 1 to 4 (500 µg/t). Release to Water Releases to water may result where wet scrubbers or other processes have liquid effluents. There is insufficient information to estimate emission factors. Any liquid effluents should be noted and their source recorded. Release to Land No release to land is expected. Release in Products No releases into the products are expected. Release in Residues Residues from the process are expected to contain PCDD/PCDF. The highest contamination is expected to be associated in dust and sludge from flue gas treatment. The amounts of such dust and sludge should be recorded and any use in other processes may lead to transfer of PCDD/PCDF. Melting in rotary drum furnaces generates 300‐500 kg salt slag per ton of Al and 10‐35 kg filter dust/t Al. Dross generated at ca. 25 kg/t Al can be reused in rotary drum furnaces (UBAVIE 2000). Concentrations of PCDD/PCDF in filter dusts have been recorded from 3 to 18,000 ng TEQ/kg (SCEP 1994, Bremmer et al. 1994). Filter dusts are produced at a rate of approximately 8% of the metal production (Dyke et al. 1997). Combined with an average concentration of 5,000 ng TEQ/kg, this",

Combined with an average concentration of 5,000 ng TEQ/kg, this gives an emission factor of 400 μg TEQ/t of product for class 2 (fine particulates). Measurement data obtained both in the European Union (BREF 2009) and in China (Ba et al. 2009) from plants assigned to class 3 show concentrations of 4‐5 ng TEQ/g of waste. Assuming the abovementioned 8% ratio, such concentrations correspond to an emission factor of 350‐400 µg TEQ/t. Therefore, an emission factor of 400 µg TEQ/t is proposed for class 2. The Italian study gave 183 μg TEQ/t and thus, the emission factor of class 1 has been changed to 200 μg TEQ/t of Al (ENEA 2003). Class 1 emission factor was confirmed. For class 3, optimized PCDD/PCDF control is implemented (including clean scrap), the lower factor of 100 μg TEQ/t should be applied to make initial estimates.

In these countries, typically PVC is separated from batteries and facilities tested had dust abatement by fabric filters and some also had scrubbers. In US tests the addition of a scrubber reduced air emissions by approximately 90% (USEPA 2000b). In the USA, the following emission factors were determined for the various types of secondary lead smelters (USEPA 2000b): Blast furnaces = 0.63‐8.81 μg TEQ/t lead, reverberatory/co‐located furnace = 0.05‐0.41 μg TEQ/t lead, and rotary furnace = 0.24‐0.66 μg TEQ/t lead. Emissions to air were about 10‐ times higher before any scrubber/APCS than in the purified air. The average emissions were 8.31 and 0.63 ng TEQ/m³ for blast furnaces before and after the scrubber, respectively; 0.41 and 0.05 ng TEQ/m³ for reverberatories/collocated furnaces before and after the scrubbers, respectively; and 0.24 and 0.66 ng TEQ/m³ for rotary kilns before and after the scrubbers, respectively.

The Italian study reported an emission factor of 5.0 μg TEQ/t of Pb for the production of secondary lead from pretreated vehicle batteries in rotary furnaces equipped with wet scrubbers. The concentrations measured at the Thai secondary lead smelter (rotary kilns with afterburners, cyclone and bagfilter) ranged from 0.021 to 0.032 ng I‐TEQ/m³ with a mean of 0.027 ng I‐TEQ/m³ for the line with the combined flue gas streams and from 0.06 to 0.11 ng I‐TEQ/m³ with a mean of 0.089 ng I‐ TEQ/m³ for line, which only operated the rotary kiln at the operational O content of about 19%. The 2 latter concentration corresponds to an emission factor of 10 µg TEQ/t of lead and therefore very well fits into class 2 (EF = 8 μg TEQ/t of lead). Concentrations measured in China (Ba et al. 2009) led to an emission factor estimate of 0.64 µg TEQ/t. The one calculated from measurements carried out in South Korea reaches 3.14 µg TEQ/t (Yu et al. 2006). The CORINAIR database provides a higher emission factor of 20 µg TEQ/t for secondary lead production sites where the efficiency of APC devices is low. Finally, data collected on three Japanese plants corresponding to class 3 were used to assess an emission factor of 0.06 µg TEQ/t (Iwata et al. 2008). An emission factor of 8 μg TEQ/t of lead produced is to be used for furnaces fitted with fabric filters where PVC is excluded from battery separators (class 2). An estimated factor of 80 μg TEQ/t is used where PVC may be present (class 1), this assessment being highly uncertain as no references are supporting it.

An estimated factor of 80 μg TEQ/t is used where PVC may be present (class 1), this assessment being highly uncertain as no references are supporting it.

The former study derived an emission factor of 0.0037 µg TEQ/t, whereas the latter derived an emission factor of 0.31 µg TEQ/t. A mean value of 0.2 µg TEQ/t is thus proposed for class 2. Assuming that PCB emissions are lower than 10% of PCDD/PCDF emissions (expressed as TEQ), emission factors are proposed for class 1 (2 µg TEQ/t) and for class 3 (0.002 µg TEQ/t). Regarding HCB air emissions, a Japanese reference gives emission factors of 990 µg/t for a lead recovery plant and of 340 µg/t for a lead primary melting plant (Iwata et al. 2008). Therefore a common emission factor of 1,000 µg/t is proposed for classes 1 to 3 and an emission factor of 350 µg/t for class 4. Release to Water A release to water may result where effluents are discharged. There is not enough data to estimate an emissions factor. The presence of any liquid discharge should be noted and its source within the process recorded. Release to Land No release to land is expected. Release in Products No PCDD/PCDF is expected in the refined lead. Release in Residues PCDD/PCDF will be present in flue gas treatment residues. Tests in Germany (SCEP 1994) reported concentrations between 2,600 and 3,100 ng TEQ/kg in dusts from a shaft furnace. Any use of residues as raw materials in other processes may result in transfer of PCDD/PCDF. An emission factor of 50 μg TEQ/t of Pb has been derived from the ENEA study (ENEA 2003). This emission factor has been confirmed by subsequent references from China (Ba et al. 2009) and South Korea (Jin et al. 2009).

European plants would be fitted with fabric filter systems to control particulate emissions (HMIP 1994, LUA 1997). In Germany, emission factors were provided for hot briquetting (63‐379 μg TEQ/t zinc with emissions between 89 and 953 ng TEQ/m³, mean = 521 ng TEQ/m³), a rotating cylinder furnace (62.3 μg TEQ/t with emissions between 10 and 335 ng TEQ/m³; mean = 175 ng TEQ/m³) and for zinc melting (typically under 0.1 ng TEQ/m³ (LUA 1997). Although this data set is very limited initial estimations of releases may be obtained by applying the emission factor of 100 μg TEQ/t of zinc produced where hot briquetting or rotary furnaces are used (class 2). Where furnaces are used feeding scrap materials or filter ashes from the steel industry to recover zinc (Japanese data) and with no dust removal an estimated factor of 1,000 μg TEQ/t can be used (class 1). For high technology facilities using comprehensive pollution controls such as fabric filters with lime and active carbon injection an estimated factor of 5 μg TEQ/t can be used (class 3). Class 1 emission factor has been confirmed by recent data obtained from a Waelz kiln in Taiwan which was not equipped with any APC (3,000 µg TEQ/t, Chi 2009). In addition, the same paper confirmed class 2 emission factor from measurements on a Waelz kiln equipped with a scrubber, a cyclone and a bag filter (101 µg TEQ/t). It also measured an emission factor of 5 µg TEQ/t on a plant equipped with a comprehensive APC (scrubber, cyclone, bag filter and activated carbon injection), confirming class 3 emission factor.

The publication from Taiwan mentioned above (Chi et al. 2008) also allows for new PCB emission factors for classes 1 to 3. Class 4 PCB emission factor is derived from Polish data (Grochowalski et al. 2007). Several Japanese publications (Iwata et al. 2008, Ota et al. 2005, Sakai et al. 2009) provided HCB emission factors for secondary zinc production (classes 1 to 3). Those ranged between 42,000 and 85,000 µg/t. Therefore, an emission factor of 50,000 is proposed for these classes. The same publications also provided emission factors for primary zinc production (1,000 µg/t). Release to Water A release may occur if effluents are discharged.

Three publications issued in 2009 gave first results focused on PCDD/PCDF levels in residues from secondary zinc production. In China, an emission factor of 0.246 µg TEQ/t zinc was derived (Ba et al. 2009). In South Korea, several plants were investigated without any process and APC description being given and an emission range of 0.02‐13 µg TEQ/t zinc was provided. The third one was from a team from Taiwan which measured levels from residues produced by two Waelz kilns (260‐1,900 µg TEQ/t EAF dust). Assuming 2 t EAF dust by ton of produced zinc, this range would correspond to emission factors of 520‐3,200 µg TEQ/t zinc. Therefore an emission factor of 0.02 µg TEQ/t zinc (lower end of Jin et al. 2007 range) is proposed for class 1. For classes 2 and 3, an emission factor of 1 µg TEQ/t zinc is proposed.

The plant consisted of a small, batch‐type smelter for primary and secondary brass production. The brass from the smelter was cast manually into bars, which were then rolled into coils for different products. The furnace was heated with about 30 L/h low sulfur, heavy fuel oil. The furnace was operated on a 250 kg/batch discontinuous mode during one day shift. The flue gases from the furnace and several surrounding areas pass a wet scrubber and are then discharged through the roof via a steel stack. Emissions to air may arise from smelting processes and melting of mixed scrap. The stack concentrations from the secondary brass smelter in Thailand ranged between 0.13 and 0.21 ng I‐TEQ/Nm³ with an average of 0.15 ng I‐TEQ/Nm³ at the actual operating O 2 concentration of 19%. This concentration corresponds to an emission factor of 11 μg I‐TEQ/t of brass (11 μg WHO‐TEQ/t). Hence, an emission factor of 10 µg TEQ/t is assigned to class 2.

For plants applying the thermal reduction process (class 3), an emission factor of 3 μg TEQ/t will be used (BREF 2009). Emissions could be much higher if the gas treatment is limited or where a high PCDD/PCDF producing carbon source is used. Indeed, one of the Chinese sources mentioned above reported concentrations of 10.1 pg TEQ/Nm3 which, combined with an uncommon low production flow (1 kg/h), corresponds to a high emission factor (assumed to be higher than 500 µg TEQ/t). Regarding air emissions of PCBs and HCB, emission factors were assessed in China and are available for installations falling under both classes 2 and 3 (Nie et al. 2010). Release to Water Releases to water will depend on the amount of PCDD/PCDF formed in the process, the efficiency of the scrubbing systems to remove PCDD/PCDF in gas streams and crucially on the treatment applied to the effluents. There is insufficient information to estimate releases from processes other than those including a thermal treatment of MgO/coke in Cl . 2 For processes fitted with comprehensive water treatment (including high efficiency solids removal), an emission factor is estimated based on releases reported from the Norwegian plant in the late 1990s or under 1 g TEQ per year.

Derivation of emission factors Release to Air Work in Norway showed that a process carried out to refine primary nickel, which used a fluidized bed reactor at 800°C to convert NiCl2 to NiO, had polluted the environment heavily with PCDD/PCDF but no emission factors were given (Oehme et al. 1989). Tests in Germany have identified high emissions from tin smelting (up to 113 μg TEQ/t) but insufficient information is provided to be able to apply this emission factor to tin production processes in general (Bröker et al. 1999). Other thermal metal processes can release PCDD/PCDF and emissions will be influenced by the degree of contamination on the scrap materials and the capture and treatment of the flue gases. Lowest emissions can be expected where the raw materials are clean and gas treatment comprehensive – including dust control by fabric filters, lime injection and possibly activated carbon addition and in some cases an afterburner. Emissions will be high for installations with poor controls on input materials leading to high concentrations. Even if mass flow is small, local contamination may result. The emission factors are estimated based on patchy data on thermal non‐ferrous metal recovery, concentrations would vary widely from well under 1 ng/m³ (class 2) to tens of ng/m³ (class 1).

Table III.26.1 PCB emission factors for source category 2k Shredders 2k Shredders Emission Factors (μg TEQ/t recovered steel) Classification Air Water Land Product Residue 1 Metal shredding 0.4 15 plants Emission factors for air emissions are provided with a high level of confidence, as these are derived from a broad geographical coverage and are based on a low data range and not on expert judgment. Emission factors for residues releases are provided with a low level of confidence, as these are based on extrapolations and expert judgment. Derivation of emission factors Release to Air Emissions arise due to the presence of PCB and PCDD/PCDF contained in the feed to the shredder plants such as motor vehicles, household electrical equipment, or other electrical appliances, and are released to the air by the mechanical destruction. An emission factor of 0.2 μg TEQ/t (concentration of 0.04‐0.4 ng TEQ/m³) is developed based on data provided by SCEP (1994). This emission factor is confirmed by two other European publications (Schleicher et al. 2009, François et al. 2005). Mean concentrations of 0.14 ng TEQ/Nm3 and 0.023 ng TEQ/Nm3 (10 samples) were measured respectively. Assuming a production of 80 t/h and a gas flow of 65,000 Nm3/h, such concentrations would correspond to emission factors ranging from 0.019 to 0.30 µg TEQ/t of recovered steel. These two publications also give PCB measurement data. The Belgian one (10 samples from 3 plants) shows concentrations from 0.025 to 0.74 ng TEQ/Nm3 which would correspond to a mean emission factor of 0.32 µg TEQ/t. The Swedish one (10 samples) show concentrations ranging from 0.29 to 0.94 ng TEQ/Nm3, corresponding to a mean emission factor of 0.45 µg TEQ",

The Swedish one (10 samples) show concentrations ranging from 0.29 to 0.94 ng TEQ/Nm3, corresponding to a mean emission factor of 0.45 µg TEQ/t of recovered steel. Therefore, a PCB emission factor of 0.4 µg TEQ/t is proposed for the purpose of the Toolkit. The fact that PCB emission factors are higher than PCDD/PCDF emission factors should be highlighted. Release to Water A release to water could occur where effluents are discharged. No data were available to estimate emission factors. Any liquid discharge should be reported and any treatment applied. Release to Land No release to land is expected. 257\n\n2k Shredders | | Emission Factors (μg TEQ/t recovered steel) | | | | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- Classification | | Air | Water | Land | Product | Residue 1 | Metal shredding plants | 0.4 | | | | 15",

Release in Residues Residues may be materials from dust removal devices or unsellable products from the shredding operation (non‐metallic materials). The Belgian study mentioned above also reported data on PCDD/PCDF releases through residues. A value of 0.023 ng TEQ/g of residue is reported. Assuming a release of 200 kg of residues/t of product, such a concentration would correspond to a PCDD/PCDF emission factor of 5 µg TEQ/t of recovered steel.

A new class was added to cover open burning of circuit boards (new class 2). Some new emission factors for PCBs are also proposed with a medium level of confidence.

Highest concentrations reported for thermal wire reclamation were 254 ng TEQ/m³ (Dutch data) and emission factors up to 500 μg TEQ/t were used in the Dutch and Austrian inventories (LUA 2000); lowest were 3.3 μg TEQ/t. The Swiss inventory applied an emission factor of 2,340 μg TEQ/t (LUA 2000). A literature review and additional experiments carried out in the USA gave very different emission factors for cables on the one hand and circuit boards on the other hand: 28‐155 µg TEQ/t for the former and 5,400‐18,100 for the latter (Gullett et al. 2007). Experiments achieved in Japan on cable burning showed similar emission factors (Shibata et al. 2003). Therefore, a new class 2 assigned to open burning of circuit boards is proposed. New emission factors for class 1 (open burning of cables) and class 2 (open burning of circuit boards) are proposed to be 12,000 µg TEQ/t and 100 µg TEQ/t respectively.

Any similar recovery operations should be looked at and a note made of the controls applied and any gas cleaning in use. Dioxin‐related compounds in house dust from Vietnamese e‐waste recycling sites were characterized and it was shown that PCBs accounted for 3% of the PCDD/PCDF TEQ (Tue et al. 2010).

Release to Water Where a furnace is used and a wet scrubber is present a release to water is expected. The presence of wet scrubber systems at such plants should be noted, the fate of effluent and any treatment applied to the effluent noted. No data has been found to derive emission factors. Release to Land Releases to land are expected to occur where open processing takes place, the residues in this case will be on the ground. At illegal burning sites, soil concentrations up to 98,000 ng TEQ/kg have been measured. In other cases where residues are removed these will be considered in the Section on residues. In the case of open cable burning contamination of the land can be significant and sites should be identified as potential hotspots. Release in Products No release into the copper product is expected. Release in Residues Residues from the process are expected to contain PCDD/PCDF and levels may be high.

Further, consumption numbers for gaseous fuels, such as natural gas, may be given in cubic meters (m³). For the Toolkit, these volumes have to be converted into tons or heating values. For the purpose of the Toolkit: • 1 L of gasoline has a mass of about 0.74 kg; thus, a conversion factor of 0.00074 must be used to convert liters of gasoline into tons; • 1 L of (normal) Diesel fuel (for automobiles, trucks, etc.) and/or light fuel oil (including heating oil) has a mass of about 0.85 kg; thus, a conversion factor of 0.00085 must be used to convert liters of Diesel and/or light fuel oil into tons; • 1 L of heavy duty fuel has a mass of about 0.970 kg; thus, a conversion factor of 0.00097 must be used to convert liters of heavy duty fuel into tons; • 1 m³ of natural gas has a mass between 0.77 and 0.85 kg; with a mean of 0.8 kg; thus, a conversion factor of 0.0008 must be used to convert m³ of natural gas into tons; a conversion factor of 0.0000008 must be used to convert liters of natural gas into tons; • 1 m³ of LPG (mixture of propane and butane) has a mass of about 2 kg; thus, a conversion factor of 0.002 must be used to convert m³ of LPG into tons and a conversion factor of 0.000002 must be applied to convert liters of LPG into tons.

Investigations included air emissions and releases into residues. The revision of the information related to source group 3 focused on the following aspects: • Review of existing emission factors • Review of proposed source categories • Further information to be included on non‐ conventional fuels • Derivation of emission factors for „simple“ technologies In source category 3a “Fossil fuel power plants”, a new class was introduced and a new dioxin emission factor was proposed to cover releases from peat fired power boilers. The proposed emission factor refers to peat combustion in boilers for heat and/or power production. Peat is used in countries where it is domestically available. As for class 2 covering coal fired power boilers, it should be noted that the use of high‐chlorine coal induces higher releases to air, of up to 200 µg TEQ/TJ. Derivation of emission factors Release to Air Releases to air are the predominant vector for fossil fuel combustion. Typically, measured concentrations from large power plants are far below 0.1 ng TEQ/m³; mostly one to two orders of magnitude for solid and liquid fuels. Whereas Dutch data from large coal‐fired power plants gave an emission factor of 0.35 μg TEQ/t, German data were between 0.004 and 0.2 μg TEQ/t (0.09 and 7.1 μg TEQ/TJ) and UK data had a median value of 0.14 μg TEQ/t (range: 0.06‐0.32 μg TEQ/t). Swiss sources gave mean emission factors of 230 μg TEQ/TJ for coal‐fired power plants. German data report between 0.02 and 0.03 μg TEQ/TJ for natural gas‐fired boilers (LUA 1997). The default emission factor for class 1 was derived from values reported between 0.4 and 118 μg TEQ/TJ. For the Toolkit, a median value of 35 μg TEQ/TJ was chosen. Class 2 emission factor was derived from average values reported between 230 (Swiss data",

The reported values vary in a broad range from 3 ‐100 µg TEQ/TJ and depend highly on fuel quality and power plant technology.

Class 3 emission factor was derived based on McGettigan (2009). Class 4 was derived from average values reported between 1 and 4 μg TEQ/TJ. Class 5 is based from emission measurements taken at two power plants in Estonia firing shale oil, which gave emissions between 2.3 and 24 pg I‐TEQ/Nm³ (at 10% O ).

Release to Land No release to land is expected unless untreated residue is directly placed onto or mixed with soil. Release in Products The process has no product; thus no release to product occurs. Release in Residues There is a scarcity of measured data for PCDD/PCDF concentrations in fly ash and more data will be needed. It can be assumed that the content of PCDD/PCDF in the fly ash increases with the content of unburned carbon and the amount of waste co‐fired. Estonia, where power plants use shale oil as a fuel, PCDD/PCDF have been analyzed in fly ashes from power plants, which were equipped with electrostatic precipitators. The concentrations in these fly ashes ranged from non quantifiable concentrations to 1.66 ng I‐TEQ/kg of dry ash (LOQ included for TEQ calculation) (Schleicher et al. 2004a, Roots 2001). The data do not enable determination of emission factor and thus, countries that wish to quantify the releases from the power plants fuelled with shale oil and are equipped with ESPs, may wish to multiply the mean of the above two measurements (= 1.2 g TEQ/t of ESP fly ash) with the mass of fly ash collected from these plants. To make a preliminary estimate, UK data on PCDD/PCDF in residues from industrial coal combustion can be used (Dyke et al. 1997, EC 1999a). Concentrations in fly ash were 0.23‐8.7 ng TEQ/kg ash and grate ash gave 0.02‐13.5 ng TEQ/kg. The concentrations in soot were higher (up to 53 ng TEQ/kg).

Straw‐fired boilers need to be adapted to this fuel with regard to ash properties (slagging) and combustion conditions. Due to the chlorine content of straw, PCDD/PCDF emissions are expected to be higher than clean wood. As for boiler fired with various types of herbaceous biomass such as rice husk or bagasse, these are especially used in Asian countries, along with a wide range of agricultural residues. Nevertheless, information on PCDD/PCDF emissions from this source is still scarce. Derivation of emission factors Release to Air Releases to air are the predominant vector for biomass combustion. The default emission factor for class 1 was derived from average values for straw combustion reported for the UK ranging between 17 and 54 μg TEQ/t. Data reported from Austria ranges between 2–500 μg TEQ/TJ. Based on an average heating value of about 8–11 MJ/kg a default emission factor of 500 μg TEQ/TJ was chosen as a representative value even though values as high as 5,000 μg TEQ/TJ could be found. Class 2 was derived from mean values reported between 4.7 (Belgian study) and 5.4 (UK study) μg TEQ/t of wood burned. Based on an average heating value of 12–15 MJ/kg, a default emission factor of about 350 ng TEQ/GJ can be calculated. (LUA 1997, IFEU 1998, Environment Canada 1999). The factor of class 3 characterizing emissions into the air is based on Schleicher (2002).

Due to the large overlap in values reported for bottom ash and fly ash, no further differentiation was deemed necessary. Thus, an average value of 3,000 ng TEQ/kg based on an ash content of 0.5% was chosen as a default emission factor. New 268",

The results of this pilot project, including measurements of PCDD/PCDF, PCB and HCB emissions from four simple stoves using wood as fuel, with limited combustion control and a duct for the evacuation of flue gases, were used to revise and amend emission factors to air and residues. Results obtained suggest daily fluctuations of PCDD/PCDF levels according to the cooking pattern. Four new classes were added in this category, as follows: • Straw fired stoves, including all types of residential combustion using herbaceous biomass as a fuel such as straw pellets. • Charcoal fired stoves, including all types of residential combustion using charcoal as a fuel. Higher emissions may nevertheless occur from barbecuing. • Open‐fire (3‐stone) stoves (virgin wood), including residential combustion of wood without control of combustion conditions and without ducts for the evacuation of flue gases. Traditional 3‐stone stoves are a typical example. • Simple stoves (virgin wood) used for cooking with limited combustion control and with a duct for the evacuation of flue gases. Emission factors for dioxin like PCB, ∑6PCB and HCB are proposed for two classes in this category, i.e. open‐fire 3‐stone stoves (virgin wood) and simple stoves (virgin wood), based on the results of the project in Mexico (Cardenas et al. 2011).

As for the PCDD/PCDF in ashes, the emission factors derived were lower than the existing ones. As it is anticipated that the use of simple stoves to substitute open fire in developing countries will increase substantially over the next years, other biomass sources or new types of devices may be considered for further investigation. Derivation of emission factors Release to Air Releases to air are the predominant vector for biomass combustion. The default emission factor for class 1 was derived from mean values reported between 2 and 50 μg TEQ/t of wood burned. The values of 2.4–4.7 μg TEQ/kg as reported in the Austrian study seems to be extraordinarily high. The values of 0.2– 0.7 μg TEQ/t as reported in the German study seem to represent the lowest end of the spectrum. So does the Swiss value of 24 ng TEQ/GJ. It is important to note that the values reported for clean biomass combustion are consistently one order of magnitude below the values reported for the combustion of contaminated biomass such as treated and/or painted wood. Thus, an average value of 1.5 μg TEQ/t was chosen for clean biomass where as a value of around 25 μg TEQ/t was used for contaminated biomass. Based on an average heating value of 12–15 MJ/kg for wood, default emission factors of about 100 μg TEQ/TJ can be calculated for clean biomass and 1,500 μg TEQ/TJ for contaminated biomass (LUA 1997, IFEU 1998).

The proposed value of 100 µg TEQ/TJ has to be considered as an expert estimate based on Schleicher (2002). New emission factors for classes 5 and 6 are based on Cardenas et al. (2011). Release to Water No release to water is expected. Release to Land No release to land is expected unless the combustion takes place directly on the soil. Due to a lack of data, no default emission factor could be derived. Release in Products The process has no product, thus no release to product occurs. Release in Residues PCDD/PCDF in the ash residue range from a few nanogram to several thousand ng TEQ/kg (or μg TEQ/t, respectively). Combustion of virgin wood will generate lower concentrations in the ash whereas treated wood results in higher concentrations. The mean concentrations determined by Wunderli et al. (1996) will be used in the Toolkit as a first estimate: they determined an average of 1,000 ng I‐TEQ/kg of ash generated for contaminated wood and 10 ng I‐TEQ/kg of ash generated for clean wood. For peat as a fuel, no TEQ‐based results were found. However, a publication by Mehrag and Killkam (2003) found 60.6 ng PCDD/PCDF (tetra‐through octachlorinated homologs) per kg of peat ash in a sample from the 19th century. Applying the emission factor of class 2 for peat ash is suggested. Utilization of this factor would not underestimate the release. The new class 3 emission factor for straw fired stoves is derived from Launhardt (2000). This value refers to the range reported for combustion chamber ash (5‐33 ng TEQ/kg). Concentrations in heat exchanger ash are typically higher. With regard to mixed ashes a value at the upper end of the range is proposed.

In most cases this category applies to the co‐ firing of coal, biomass and waste. Nevertheless, co‐ firing of waste in residential appliances is an illegal practice in many countries. • Peat fired stoves, including domestic stoves, ovens and boilers firing peat. The use of peat as a fuel in the residential sector is closely linked to its local availability. • Coal/coke‐fired simple stoves, including coal ore coke fired simple stoves for cooking with limited combustion control. The proposed dioxin emission factor for air is of 200 µg TEQ/TJ. High chlorine coal fired stoves may show significantly higher emissions (Air: 1,500 µg TEQ/TJ coal, Residue: 5,000 ng TEQ/kg ash). Derivation of emission factors Release to Air Releases to air are the predominant vector for fossil fuel combustion. For coal, three classes of emission factors are proposed since there are distinct ranges of PCDD/PCDF emissions reported in the literature. The default emission factor for class 3 was derived from mean values reported between 1.6 and 50 μg TEQ/t of coal burned, which is reported from most European countries. It is important to note that the values reported for domestic coal combustion are fairly consistent between 1 and 7 μg TEQ/t of coal burned. Thus, an average value of 3 μg TEQ/t was chosen for typical coal. Based on an average heating value of 30 MJ/kg for coal, a default emission factor of about 100 μg TEQ/TJ can be calculated. On the other hand, an Austrian study reported a much higher value of 0.91 mg TEQ/t as well as the Swiss value of 230 ng TEQ/GJ also seems to be somewhat on the high side (LUA 1997). However, emission factors in the same range were recently reported for small residential stoves when coal or briquettes from Poland were burned resulting in an emission factor as high as 200 µg TEQ/TJ (Grochowals",

Kubica et al. (2004) reported emission factors between 108.5 μg TEQ/t and 663.9 μg I‐TEQ/t of coal burned. These high values may be explained by the high chlorine content – ranges from traces to 0.4% and maxima up to 1.5% of chlorine ‐ in the coal from Poland. For an average of 400 μg I‐TEQ/t of coal burned and with an average heating value of 25 MJ/kg for bituminous coal from Poland (and coals from other regions with similar specifications), a class 1 default emission factor of 1,700 μg TEQ/TJ (Pandelova 2005). However, the role of chlorine concentration in the reaction gases from hard coal firing in combustion processes is not yet clearly explained. There are many processes inhibiting PCDD/PCDF formation as well. The NaCl content in coal seems to be less important in light of data obtained from recent measurements. These results indicate that even for 0,5 ‐ 1% of NaCl (high chlorine coal) in coal fired in modern CFB boilers, PCDD/PCDF emissions are less than previously expected. 274",

Additional guidance has been introduced on classifying sources within this category, estimating activity rates, and on data quality aspects. Derivation of emission factors Release to Air Emissions to air in terms of PCDD/PCDF produced per unit production will be influenced by the concentration of the PCDD/PCDF in the flue gas and the amount of gas produced per unit production. A larger volume of flue gas is generated in wet kilns per unit output than in dry kilns. Modern kilns produce between 1,500 and 2,500 m³ per ton of clinker (BREF 2010). The SINTEF study is based on more than 1,700 PCDD/PCDF measurements from the early 1990s until recently. It summarizes emissions to air from wet and dry kilns and from plants operating on fossil fuels and “natural” raw materials and plants utilizing alternative raw materials and alternative fuels. These alternative fuels and raw materials, including wastes, were co‐fired to the main burner, to the rotary kiln inlet or the preheater/precalciner. In many countries, this is usual practice. The vast majority of the data reported have PCDD/PCDF concentrations far below 0.1 ng TEQ/m³; emissions from dry kilns may be slightly lower than those from wet kilns. Emissions in this range correspond to emission factors below 0.05 μg TEQ/t of cement. These plants were considered BAT and the emission factor represents class 4. However, the SINTEF study also includes some old data – from U.S.A. – which had an emission of up to 25.8 ng TEQ/m³, which corresponds to an emission factor of 16.7 μg TEQ/t of cement (SINTEF 2006). Very low concentrations of PCDD/PCDF were found in the sampling campaign in Thailand at a cement plant utilizing the dry process.

Thus, all test results were far below the orientation value of 0.1 ng TEQ/Nm³. The results demonstrated that the addition of tires and/or liquid hazardous waste had no effect on the emission results keeping in mind that the dry cement kiln process employed in the cement plant is state‐of‐the‐art technology and the plant is well‐ managed (UNEP 2001, Fiedler et al. 2002). Concentration of PCDD/PCDF in the flue gases seems to be influenced by the temperature of the dust collection device. Low temperatures (<200°C) seem to indicate that typical concentrations will be under 0.1 ng TEQ/Nm³, temperatures over 300°C increase the likelihood of finding higher emissions, typical concentrations would be 0.3 ng TEQ/Nm³ and above. In some cases much higher emissions may be 276",

These seem to be linked to high dust collector temperatures, high levels of organic matter in the raw materials and may be linked to use of certain wastes under inappropriate conditions. For the purpose of this Toolkit, an average emission factor of 5 μg TEQ/t of cement is applied for old kilns and with dust collectors operating at temperatures above 300°C (derived from old US data) for class 2. An average emission factor of 0.6 μg TEQ/t of cement is applied where the dust collector is between 200 and 300°C (class 3). An emission factor of 0.05 μg TEQ/t of cement is applied for modern plants where dust collector temperature is held below 200°C (class 4). Since there are no measured PCDD/PCDF data available for shaft kilns, no emission factor could be calculated and provisionally, class 1 has been incorporated for this technology and the same emission factor assigned as for the old wet kilns. Release to Water Releases to water are not expected. However, if effluents are identified these should be noted and the origin in the process described. Release to Land Some residues may be spread on land, in some cases the use of cement kiln dust to increase alkalinity and add lime has been reported. Any use of cement kiln dust (CKD) in this manner should be noted. Release in Products Releases in the cement product are expected to be small since the product has been exposed to very high temperatures. Release in Residues It should be mentioned that the dusts collected in air pollution control systems, typically electrostatic precipitators (ESP) or cyclones, mainly consist of raw materials fed into the kiln (at the end of the secondary burner). The remainder of the dust consists of emissions from the kiln that has passed the hot zone. Typically, the dusts from the ESPs/cyclones or bagfilters are re‐introduced into the kiln. In cases where solid residues from flue gas cleaning equipment are not recycled into the kiln, an initial estimate of release of PCDD/PCDF in CKD would be based on the assumption that approximately 30 kg of CKD per ton of clinker (0.03% of clinker production) is generated.

Derivation of emission factors Release to Air Emissions have been measured from a number of German kilns (SCEP 1994). An emission factor of 0.07 μg TEQ/t of lime produced is to be used where lime kilns are well controlled and fitted with dust abatement equipment (typically electrostatic precipitator or fabric filter). However, individual plants found in Europe (3 kilns, 2 rotary kilns and 1 shaft kiln in Sweden n the years between 1989 and 1993) showed measured concentrations between 4.1 and 42 ng N‐TEQ/Nm³. All measurements of high PCDD/PCDF emissions were explained either by the raw material and/or fuel content, or the less than optimum burning conditions, underlining the importance of controlling the kiln inputs and maintaining a stable kiln operation (BREF 2010). Considerably higher emissions were also quoted for limited tests (LUA 1997), and an emission factor of 10 μg TEQ/t of lime produced is to be applied where control of the kilns is limited and dust control is basic (cyclone) or absent. Raw materials or fuels that contain chlorides may potentially cause the formation of PCDD/PCDF in the combustion process of the lime kiln. Data reported from Europe, obtained from seven kilns, of which four were rotary kilns and three were shaft kilns, showed PCDD/PCDF concentrations below 0.1 ng TEQ/Nm³. Measurements at two annular shaft kilns in Germany were all below 0.05 ng TEQ/Nm³. However, the scarcity of measurements means it cannot be ruled out that individual plants may be found in Europe and elsewhere, which may have a local impact (LUA 1997). High concentrations of PCDD/PCDF have been measured at three kilns, 2 rotary kilns and one shaft kiln, in Sweden.

Finally, the existing classes were further refined to better reflect the specific processes and technologies used in developing countries. Consequently, class 2 was amended to include technologies with no emission abatement in place and using non‐contaminated fuels, using emission abatement and any kind of fuel, and with no emission abatement in place but state of the art process control. Some hotspot situations were encountered during the field study. Significantly high levels of PCDD/PCDF were detected in ash and bricks of some Mexican sites co‐incinerating waste, and indicate the need to assess further whether these data represent another category. Furthermore, typical Asian kiln types could not be included in this study, and further work should be done to include information on these types of kilns as well.

The plants tested had fabric filters and some used cyclones as a pre‐separator for dust. An average emission factor of 0.007 μg TEQ/t of product is to be applied to plants with this type of gas cleaning. For plants without fabric filters an emission factor of 0.07 μg TEQ/t of product is applied (assuming fabric filters would capture approximately 90% of PCDD/PCDF).

Additional guidance has been introduced on classifying sources within this category, estimating activity rates, and on data quality aspects. Derivation of emission factors Release to Air From an Estonian plant, two sets of emission data were reported – 0.40‐4.8 pg TEQ/m³ (at 6% O ) and 2 0.23‐4.2 pg TEQ/m³ (at 6% O ). The corresponding emission factors were calculated to be from 0.2 to 3.5 2 ng TEQ/t of oil shale. For the purpose of this Toolkit, a preliminary emission factor of 0.003 μg TEQ/t oil shale was chosen (Schleicher et al. 2004b). According to Schleicher et al. (2004b), incoming oil shale is heated with hot flue gas, separated in cyclones and mixed with hot ash to attain the reaction temperature of at least 480°C. Kerogen is fractionated into gas, condensable oil, and a solid residue. The decomposition of the kerogen starts at around 300°C and proceeds more rapidly at higher temperatures (480‐520°C). The vapor phase is cooled to result in an oil fraction and a gaseous phase. The gas is typically burned in a power plant and the oil fraction is further fractionated into heavy oil, light oil, diesel, and gasoline. A substantial part of the oil is used to heat up the Estonian power plant. The solid residue is subsequently burned with excess air in a special furnace at 750‐800°C.

Studies by several authors (Hagenmaier et al. 1990, Oehme et al. 1991, Abrantes et al. 2011) have shown that the emission factor for gasoline cars equipped with catalyst is not null, as suggested previously. Although the emission factor for this class is very small, a high number of these vehicles is in use worldwide. Further, a new class ‘ethanol fuel (with catalyst)’ was introduced. Abrantes et al. (2011) showed that ethanol powered vehicles have lower emissions than gasoline powered vehicles. Thus an emission factor for ethanol vehicles equipped with catalyst is also considered. Derivation of emission factors Release to Air The annual average mileage, type and level of maintenance of vehicles are different worldwide. The use of leaded fuels decreased dramatically in Europe, Japan, and North America as a result of legislation; however, leaded fuel is still used in some other countries. Phase‐out of leaded gasoline and adoption of catalytic converters as required in the EU Guideline 94/12/EG or similar legislation means that 4‐stroke gasoline engines will become an almost negligible source of PCDD/PCDF emissions to air. The emission factors listed in the Toolkit are based on studies in Germany and Belgium. Other countries, like North America and Asia, have very limited data on vehicle emissions. Recent work on gasohol (gasoline with 22% ethanol) and ethanol powered vehicles, with a three‐way catalyst in good working conditions, showed PCDD/PCDF releases of 0.39 10‐3 and 0.25 103 µg TEQ/t of fuel burned, respectively for gasohol and ethanol vehicles (Abrantes et al. 2011). The average results obtained by Abrantes et al. (2011), Hagenmaier (1990) and Oehme et al. (1991) are of 0.00075 µg TEQ/t of fuel burned. Thus, an emission factor to air of 0.001 µg TEQ/t of fuel burned is specified for class 3. Based on these results, an emission",

So far, only passenger cars and trucks have been assessed; there are no data for off‐road diesel uses (i.e., construction vehicles, farm vehicles, and stationary equipment). From USA, there are two tailpipe studies where the Californian Air Resources Board reported a relatively high emission factor of 676 pg TEQ/km, corresponding to 3.2 μg TEQ/t of Diesel (assuming a consumption of 1 L Diesel for a 5.5 km distance driven; CARB 1987). Another study tested heavy‐duty trucks and determined a range of emission factors from 3.0 to 96.8 pg TEQ/km (mean of 29.0 pg TEQ/km), corresponding to 0.014‐0.453 μg TEQ/t of Diesel with a mean of 0.14 μg TEQ/t of Diesel (Gullett and Ryan 1997).

If efficient soot filters are employed, emissions from consumption of Diesel fuel are much lower; currently, only a small proportion of vehicles in use are equipped with this technology. Lin et al.

The results showed PCDD/PCDF emissions of 1.43 ng TEQ/L, corresponding to 1.7 µg TEQ/t of premium diesel fuel, and 0.904 n TEQ/L, corresponding to 1.08 µg TEQ/t of B20 fuel 288",

Cooper (2005) found an emission value of 0.5 µg TEQ/t of fuel burned, based on measurements on three ships, using marine gas oil or residual oil. Based on an array of studies, the revised emission factor value for this class is of 2 µg TEQ/t of fuel burned. Emission factors for other unintentional POPs (HCB and PCB) were also derived based on Cooper (2005) and are listed below.

Measured data from the burning of recycled waste oils are available from Austria, where emissions from a small incinerator gave a concentration of 0.02 ng TEQ/Nm³ (at 11% O ) equivalent to an emission 2 factor of 0.37 μg TEQ/t of waste oil burned (LUA 1997). Dutch data from two small firing installations and a ferry determined a minimum of 0.1 ng TEQ/m³ and a maximum of 0.3 ng TEQ/m³ equivalent to emission factors of 2 μg TEQ/t and 6.5 μg TEQ/t, respectively.

Especially one project commissioned by the Secretariat of the Stockholm Convention and implemented by UNEP Chemicals Branch improved the measurement techniques by running the same samples in open burn hut and field sampling methods; i.e., the US‐EPA Open Burn‐hut Facility and the Australian “whoozle” technique by EnTox and CSIRO (Black et al. 2011a, UNEP 2011b). The same project also assessed all measured data and recommended an improved classification scheme and new emission factors for PCDD/PCDF. Suggested improvements included a new emission class, sugarcane burning, and substantial revisions to emission factors to land (Black et al. 2011b). Because better simulations or even field studies are available now, the older references have been removed from this section and replaced by the more recent studies.

This project entailed measurements of PCDD/PCDF air emissions from 21 field burns and 19 laboratory tests (Meyer et al. 2004a; Meyer et al. 2004b). Forest fire simulations in an laboratory burn facility were used to estimate PCDD/PCDF emission factors of 19 µg TEQ/t of fuel (range 1‐56 µg TEQ/t of fuel) for biomass from Oregon and North Carolina (Gullett and Touati 2003b). Further forest fire simulations (Gullett et al. 2008) produced PCDD/PCDF emission factors ranging from 0.15 µg TEQ/t of fuel to 13 µg TEQ/t of fuel from forest biomass collected from four regions in North Carolina. Release to Water No EF is given since no direct release to water is expected. It should be noted that rainfall may wash Water away ash particles and some of this may enter water courses with relevance to subsequent contamination of receiving waters including sediments. Release to Land PCDD/PCDF are expected to be present in residues, which may be left on land or incorporated into the field surface constituting a release to land. PCDD/PCDF may be expected to be present in the ashes from fires. In some cases, these ashes may be used for their mineral content in agriculture. Ash production from these fires will vary with the conditions and the nature of the material combusted. For class 1 and 2, Zhang et al.

The projects included field experiments in Mexico and China that added a total of 30 results to improve the emission factors for dump fires (class 1) and burning of loosely arranged domestic waste (class 3) (Solorzano‐Ochoa et al. 2012, Zhang et al. 2011, UNEP 2011a). Besides providing new emission factors, the characterization of the activity has also been made more specific and a protocol and a sampler for undertaking field sampling have been developed.

For open burning of domestic waste, Zhang et al. (2011) measured PCDD/PCDF releases to air from 20 field burns of urban, semi‐urban and rural wastes in China and Mexico using a newly developed sampling system. In China, the contents of each type of waste were based on literature surveys and field observation of wastes. For the ten field burns in China, an average EF of 18 ng TEQ/kg (range 3.0 to 51 Air ng TEQ/kg) was determined. In Mexico, waste compositions were based on results of sampling and analyzing materials at landfills in rural, semi‐urban and urban‐industrial areas of Mexico. For the ten field burns in Mexico, an average EF of 20.4 ng TEQ/kg (range 35 to 650 ng TEQ/kg) was derived. Air In Sweden, Hedman et al.

Therefore, for the determination of emission factors for open burning of waste at landfills and waste dumps in this Toolkit, only large scale, field experiments were further assessed. Thirty recent field experiments were conducted in four campaigns (Solorzano Ochoa et al. 2011, Zhang et al. 2011), three in Mexico and one in China. EF for PCDD/PCDF (in TEQ) spanned over three orders Air of magnitude, i.e., ranged from 13 μg TEQ/t C to 14,000 μg TEQ/t C .20 In one of the Mexican burned burned campaigns, although only six experiments were performed, extremes of conditions (stirred combustion to compacted, moistened, waste without stirring) were performed on the same waste composition. In these experiments, the EF spanned over two orders of magnitude (from 290 μg TEQ/t C to 14,000 Air burned μg TEQ/t C ). The stirred experiments generated the lowest emission factors and the unstirred, burned compacted experiment with added water yielded the highest (Solorzano Ochoa et al. 2011, Zhang et al. 2011). Higher EF are observed at higher ratios of CO/CO ; both occurred at later stages of the burning Air 2 experiments when mass loss was lowest. These experiments suggest that unattended, smoldering, poorly oxygenated open burning yields the highest emissions. Better combustion conditions, induced by stirring (presumably better oxygen supply and higher combustion temperatures), give rise to less‐polluting open burning. Such conclusion is consistent with the recommendations that were provided in the BAT&BEP guidance document elaborated for the Stockholm Convention (UNEP 2007). This also means that only small piles could be stirred and large‐scale open burnings of entire dumps may be analogous to the unstirred experiments. 20 C is calculated from the carbon content of CO and CO resulting from combustion and are assumed to burned 2 comprise the totality of airborne carbon, with other forms negligible by comparison. 296",

Promoting good combustion conditions seems to be a solid and basic principle; however, considerable additional work should be done to fully understand the mechanistic factors that drive the emission factors towards the higher or lower end of the scale. These experiments also allowed derivation of EF for dl‐PCB whereas Air the sampling method was not optimized to securely derive EF for the more volatile unintentional Air POPs, namely hexachlorobenzene (HCB) and pentachlorobenzene (PeCBz). Since the last version of the Toolkit, no additional information was found for class 6b2 – Accidental fires in houses, factories. Materials burned and conditions experienced in accidental fires vary enormously. Limited data are available giving air emissions from such fires. Given the difficulties of measuring air emissions, most studies have used laboratory simulations or measured PCDD/PCDF in soot and residues. Some studies have considered air emissions from the burning of PVC only and provided air emission factors based on soot production in the range 40‐3,500 μg TEQ/t (based on summary by Carroll 1996). These factors were based on results from laboratory and real fire samples and assume that 20% of the PVC remains unburned and that all emissions to air are captured in the soot. Merk et al. (1995) burned wood and PVC in a closed room and measured levels of PCDD/PCDF in the air/flue gas in the room as well as in wipe samples from the walls. Assuming all the air in the room was contaminated at the levels measured an EF of 560 μg TEQ/t of PVC or 51 μg TEQ/t of the wood/PVC mixture is obtained. Further it Air was assumed that deposited soot is additional to this a further 2,200 μg TEQ/t PVC or 200 μg TEQ/t PVC/wood mixture was produced.

Testing in Denmark of PCDD/PCDF released from burning chemicals (Vikelsoe and Johansen 2000) showed an enormous range of air emission factors (at 500°C) from 1 μg TEQ/t for dichlobenil, up to 740,000 μg TEQ/t for pentachlorophenol (PCP), and 100 μg TEQ/t for PVC. At 900°C yields were greatly reduced. After a review of accidental fire data, air emission factors for residential fires of 83 μg TEQ/t to air, 83 μg TEQ/t in locally deposited soot and for industrial fires 500 μg TEQ/t to air and 500 μg TEQ/t in locally deposited soot were developed for Germany (LUA 1997).

The emissions to air were from 71.1 g‐I‐TEQ per car to 86.8 g I‐TEQ per vehicle. Combining the results from the Wichmann et al. (1995) and Lönnermark and Berqvist (2006), an EF of 100 g per vehicle was Air assigned. This EF is per incident not per ton of material. Air No change was undertaken for class 6b5. It is relatively common to see fires used to dispose of wastes from construction and demolition – these are often predominantly burning wood but may also be used to dispose of other materials. Again little information is available either on the amounts burned or on emissions. When Wasson et al. (2005) burned aged and weathered chromated copper arsenate (CCA) treated wood was burned in USEPA’s burn hut, they reported PCDD/PCDF levels averaging 1.7 ng TEQ/kg of treated wood burned. Studies in Japan can be used to make an initial estimate of a suitable emissions factor to be applied – 60 μg TEQ/t (Ikeguchi and Tanaka 1999). Release to Water There is little information available on the release of PCDD/PCDF to water from these types of fires. The releases will vary considerably but highest releases may result from the use of water to extinguish a fire or rain falling on a fire site and washing material into water courses. Since these processes will depend on local circumstances it is not possible to provide emissions factors but the issue may be important. Release to Land Based on the recent experiments, an EF (or EF ) as derived from the experiments by Lemieux et Land Residue al. (2003) were revised as follows: for class 1, an EF of 10 μg TEQ/t waste and for class 3 an EF of 1 Land Land μg TEQ/t waste are proposed. The EF for classes 2, 4, and 5 remain unchanged.

For accidental fires there is little information on Land levels of PCDD/PCDF in residues. A wide range of concentrations has been measured but there is often insufficient information to estimate an emission factor since the amounts of ash produced are not known. In Germany, an estimate was made that gave emission factors in residues (including deposited soot) of 1,000 μg TEQ/t for industrial fires and 350 μg TEQ/t for residential fires (LUA 1997). As an approximation and to make an initial estimate, an emission factor of 400 μg TEQ/t is used giving equal PCDD/PCDF in air emissions and in residues on average from the fires considered. For vehicle fires the limited testing in Germany (Wichmann et al. 1995) gave amounts of PCDD/PCDF left in residues, a composite emission factor is used to make an initial estimate – 18 μg TEQ per incident (using the same assumptions as above). Note, this emission factor is per incident not per unit mass. For fires involving construction and demolition wood, no emission factors were found. To make a preliminary estimate, an emission factor of 10 μg TEQ/t wood burned is suggested (from UK work on industrial wood combustion, Dyke et al. 1997). Note that treated wood, mixed fire loads and poor conditions may increase the amount of PCDD/PCDF in residues considerably. Release in Products No EF is provided. No product is expected.

Residues are assumed to be releases to land since they are typically left in place. Residue Detailed methodology Emission factors to air were calculated as ng TEQ per kg of carbon burned (ng TEQ/kg C ). C is burned burned calculated from the carbon content of CO and CO resulting from combustion and are assumed to 2 comprise the totality of airborne carbon, with other forms negligible by comparison. Emission of PCDD/PCDF per ton of waste (μg TEQ/t waste) is calculated by multiplying EF (ng TEQ/kg C ) by the Air burned carbon content of the waste and the experimental carbon oxidation factor (COF) (Fiedler et al. 2009). A new practical approach has been developed to allow inventory developers to better characterize the activity, i.e., estimate the mass of waste, which is burned in the open air. The new method takes the whole amount of waste present for the burn event into account. The new method is based on the fact that not all organic carbon that is present in the original waste will be burned; of the carbon burned, the majority is converted to carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide; a much smaller portion to PCDD/PCDF and other organic hydrocarbons. From experimental data, it was concluded that approximately only 40% by weight of the waste is combustible carbon. In line with global climate calculations of biomass combustion, a carbon oxidation factor of 58% was applied, meaning that only 58% of the 40% combustible carbon burns, resulting in an estimated 23% of the original carbon weight is actually combusted. When the carbon content in the waste is higher and better burn‐out is obtained, the overall COF resulted in 42%. Applying the lower and the higher COF to the experimental set in Mexico, the EF Air would be obtained (Table II.46.2).

The total releases were 18,363 g TEQ and reference year, whereby 8,958 g TEQ were emitted to air and 9,405 g TEQ to land. Considering the contribution from source categories 6a and 6b, 4,610 g TEQ were from biomass burnings and 13,753 g TEQ from waste burnings or accidents. Noteworthy is that nine countries reported zero for releases from biomass (Guatemala, Pakistan, Tajikistan) or waste burnings (Bolivia, Cameroon, China, Honduras, Montenegro, Ukraine, Venezuela), respectively. Besides the difficulties to quantify the amount of material consumed in annual fires or doubts on the applicability of the emission factors, legal implications may be the driver for setting annual emissions to zero.

Release to Air For pulp and paper mills, the major sources of PCDD/PCDF release to air are power boilers used to generate heat/power, rather than the pulp and paper production processes. Fuels burned in power boilers commonly include clean hog fuel (waste wood), salt‐laden hog fuel (primarily at coastal and near‐coastal mills), black liquor, wastewater treatment sludge, and de‐inking sludge. However, clean hog fuel may also include other materials – wood product residues, plywood, agricultural wastes, paper, plastics, lubricating oils, municipal and industrial waste, rail ties, tires, etc. – that may impact PCDD/PCDF releases from power boilers (Uloth and van Heek 2002, Sinkkonen et al. 1997, Duo 2008). Using data from Canadian pulp and paper mills, Uloth and van Heek (2002) derived the air emission factors shown in Table III.47.1: Table III.47.1 PCDD/PCDF Air Emission Factors for Power Boilers Type of boiler Fuel EF (μg TEQ/t Air dry fuel) Power boilers Clean hog fuel (with or without wastewater 0.04 treatment sludge) Power boilers Clean hog fuel and de‐inking sludge (with 0.750 or without wastewater treatment sludge) Power boilers Black liquor 0.015 Kraft mill smelt dissolving tanks 0.00055 Sulfite process power boilers 0.0005 Based on Environment Canada (2002), the median and mean emissions from eleven U.S. kraft recovery furnaces were of 0.013 and 0.018 ng TEQ/kg black liquor solids (range: 6.6 x 10‐5 to 0.0724), respectively, translating to an emission factor of 0.021 and 0.029 g/ADt pulp, respectively.

Air Air Release to Water The pulp and paper industry is one of the largest industrial water users. If cooling water and other clean water are discharged separately, a bleached Kraft mill discharges water at a rate of 30‐50 m3/ADt pulp and an unbleached Kraft mill has a water discharge rate of 15‐25 m3/ADt pulp. For sulfite mills, water usage is about 70 m3/ADt pulp (EC 2001). Concentrations in effluents ranged from 3 pg TEQ/L to 210 pg TEQ/L with a median of 73 pg TEQ/L (USEPA 1998). The default emission factor for Kraft bleached pulp using old bleaching sequences is 4.5 μg TEQ/t of pulp. Alternatively, the concentration in the effluent can be used and multiplied with the total mass of water discharged per year to calculate the annual release. Data generated and published by NCASI (1998) in the USA from 20 bleach lines at 14 U.S. Kraft mills that use complete chlorine dioxide substitution for chlorine gave 119 data pairs for 2,3,7,8‐Cl DD and 2,3,7,8‐ 4 Cl DF in pulp mill effluents.

The default emission factor for releases from modern wood pulp mills utilizing chlorine dioxide will be set to 60 ng TEQ/t of bleached pulp using a conservative approach. The emission factor will be applied only if there is direct discharge into the environment. If sludge is generated, the dioxin freight will be collected in the sludge and the effluents leaving from the effluent treatment plant will have non‐ accountable concentrations of PCDD/PCDF. In China, a PCDD/PCDF concentration of 10.11 pg TEQ/L was measured in wastewater from an integrated bleached Kraft mill for cereal and rice straw (Zhang et al. 2001). At another Chinese pulp mill for reeds, a PCDD/PCDF concentration of 316 pg I‐TEQ/L was measured in wastewater from bleaching processes (Zheng et al. 2000). In Taiwan, PCDD/PCDF concentrations in raw wastewater of four pulp and paper mills ranged from 0.13 to 10.1 pg I‐TEQ/L, with a mean of 5.1 pg I‐TEQ/L, and, in the final treated effluent, PCDD/PCDF concentrations ranged from 0.06 to 0.51 pg I‐TEQ/L, with a mean of 0.3 pg I‐TEQ/L (Duh et al. 2007). In mechanical pulp and paper mills (integrated mills, TMP), the water systems are usually quite closed in order to maintain high process temperatures. Consequently, wastewater volumes are small – 5‐10 m³/ADt.

Any use of PCP or of PCP‐treated wood in the pulp and paper industry should be notified. Release in Products Products from the pulp and paper industry can be contaminated with PCDD/PCDF, depending on the bleaching technology. High concentrations of PCDD/PCDF in pulp and paper products have been reported with the use of Cl in bleaching processes. Replacing Cl with chlorine dioxide (ClO ) – so‐called 2 2 2 elemental chlorine free (ECF bleaching) – may reduce 2,3,7,8‐Cl DD and 2,3,7,8‐Cl DF concentrations to 4 4 non‐detectable levels. However, ClO commonly contains small amounts of Cl so that PCDD/PCDF 2 2 formation may still occur during ECF bleaching. The extent of such formation depends on the amount of Cl in the ClO and on the quantity of lignin remaining in the pulp (commonly expressed in “kappa 2 2 numbers”). With high kappa numbers and more Cl in the ClO , the probability of forming PCDD/PCDF 2 2 increases. U.S. EPA scientists reported an average PCDD/PCDF concentration of 22.3 ng I‐TEQ/kg in Kraft bleached pulp from five mills (Amendola et al. 1989). PCDD/PCDF concentrations ranging from 0.4 to 196 ng TEQ/kg, with a median of 8.8 ng TEQ/kg, were determined in pulp bleached using elemental chlorine or chlorine derivatives as reported in 1988 and a similar range, with a median of 7.6 ng WHO‐TEQ/kg, as reported in 1996 (USEPA 2006a). The default emission factor is 10 μg TEQ/t of Kraft bleached pulp. Chinese bleached pulps exhibited high concentrations of PCDD/PCDF (Zheng et al. 1997, 2000). Zheng et al.

Release in Residues A survey of pulp and paper mills in Canada found that total residues were generated at a rate greater than 80 kg/t of product and consisted of the following three types of residue (Elliott and Mahmood 2005): • Wastewater treatment residues (sludges resulting from primary clarification, secondary treatment and deinking operations) with a generation rate of 50 kg/t; • Fly ash and bottom ash from power and auxiliary boilers; and • \"Other inorganics\" ‐ electrostatic precipitator dust from boilers and recausticizing residues (lime mud), and grits and dregs. Among mills of all types, newsprint mills with de‐inking processes had the highest rate of residue generation, 148 kg/ADt, while newsprint mills with no de‐inking had the lowest rate, 65 kg/ADt (Elliott and Mahmood 2005). European companies report total waste generation rates from their pulp and paper mills that range from 23 to 163 kg/t of product, with a mean of 125 kg/t product (Monte et al. 2009).

The sludges have been analyzed for 2,3,7,8‐substituted Cl DD and Cl DF as well as for all 17 2,3,7,8‐ 4 4 substituted PCDD and PCDF congeners. The concentrations ranged from 3.8 ng TEQ/kg d.m. to 5.2 ng TEQ/kg d.m. for conventional delignification and from 1.8 ng TEQ/kg d.m. to 4.5 ng TEQ/kg d.m. for ED or ED/OD delignification. With an estimated average of 4 ng TEQ/kg d.m., the default emission factor for pulp sludge using modern technology will be 0.2 μg TEQ/t of pulp. Release vectors into the environment will be determined by the way the sludge is handled. Common disposal practices include landfill and surface impoundment, land application, recycling (compost, animal bedding) or incineration. Ash Ash residuals generated from power boilers combusting wood residues, sludges, or auxiliary fuels constitute a major fraction of the solid residues produced by pulp and paper mills (Elliott and Mahood 2006). In some countries, such as Canada and the U.S., landfilling is the primary method of ash disposal (Elliott and Mahood 2006). Land application of ashes produced from salt‐laden hog fuels at coastal pulp and paper mills is regulated for PCDD/PCDF. U.S. EPA (2006a) derived an EF for boiler ash of 13.2 μg I‐TEQ/t of fuel, based on five NCASI studies Residue in which wood, bark and sawdust were burned in boilers equipped with multicyclones or ESPs. Based on data from Uloth and van Heek (2002) that describe the ash generation rates for power boilers burning clean hog fuel and the PCDD/PCDF concentrations of the ashes, an estimated average EF of Residue 15.6 μgTEQ/t of fuel can be calculated, as shown in Table III.47.3: Table III.47.3 Ash generation rates and PCDD/PCDF",

BAT for new chlor‐alkali plants is generally considered to be membrane cell or non‐asbestos diaphragm cell (EU IPPCB 2011). General descriptions of the main production methods can also be found in the BAT&BEP Guidelines. EF : An EF of ND is proposed for stand‐alone chlor‐alkali facilities. Air Air EF : An EF of 0.002 μg TEQ/ECU has been derived for Class 2c chlor‐alkali facilities, and 1.7 μg Water Water TEQ/ECU for Class 2b facilities based on Dyke and Amendola (2007). Of the seven plants that were not associated with the EDC/VCM/PVC chain, emission factors were calculated based on the published data and production rates estimated to be 98% of plant capacity for the relevant years. For four plants of the seven, EF was 0.0016 μg TEQ/ECU. USEPA (2004) cited a median PCDD/PCDF concentration of 120 Water pg TEQ/L wastewater from U.S. chlor‐alkali facilities. An EF of 17 μg TEQ/ECU is recommended for Water Class 2a, approximately 10‐fold higher than Class 2b.

There are no graphite electrodes in use in the US, Europe or Japan.

For the Chinese dioxin release inventory, it is assumed that on average 50 kg of graphite sludge is generated per ton of alkali produced. With a default concentration of 20 μg TEQ/kg graphite sludge, an EF of 1,000 μg TEQ/t of chlor‐ Residue alkali is proposed, based on the most recent data. However, Sweden estimates 2.5 kg graphite consumed per ton of NaOH produced. With the latter sludge generation rate, an EF of 40 μg TEQ/t Residue can be derived. 7c Chlorinated Aliphatic Chemicals Ethylene Dichloride (EDC), Vinyl Chloride (VCM), and Polyvinyl Chloride (PVC) The major processes in the production of ethylene dichloride (EDC), vinyl chloride (VCM), and polyvinyl chloride (PVC) are as follows: 1. EDC production is accomplished by two processes ‐ direct chlorination and oxychlorination, which may be used in combination as the “balanced process”. Direct chlorination of ethylene is the catalyzed reaction of ethylene with elemental chlorine to produce EDC and HCl. The reaction is carried out at relatively low‐temperatures (50‐70°C) and pressures that are 4‐5 times normal atmospheric pressure. Ferric chloride (FeCl ) is commonly used as a catalyst, 3 although chlorides of other metals (aluminum, copper, antimony) may also be used. Oxychlorination of ethylene entails the reaction of ethylene with HCl and either air or oxygen in the presence of a catalyst (usually copper chloride) in a fixed‐bed reactor or a fluidized‐bed reactor to produce EDC and water. The balanced process for EDC production consists, in effect, of linking the direct chlorination and oxychlorination processes by recovering HCl produced during EDC thermolysis or “cracking” and using it as a reactant in the production of EDC by oxychlorination. When no EDC or HCl is imported or exported, then the EDC unit is called a ‘balanced unit’. The balanced process is used at",

When no EDC or HCl is imported or exported, then the EDC unit is called a ‘balanced unit’. The balanced process is used at many modern EDC/VCM and EDC/VCM/PVC facilities; however, import of HCl and oversized oxychlorination units have become common in recent years. 2. EDC purification usually begins with a water quench followed by caustic scrubbing. The water is returned to the process or is steam stripped prior to transfer to a water treatment system. EDC is further purified by distillation and sent to temporary storage before being used to produce VCM. 3. VCM production is carried out by thermolytic dehydrochlorination (“cracking”) of EDC to produce VCM and HCl along with various by‐products. Cracking furnaces typically operate at temperatures of 450‐ 650°C and pressures about 20 times normal atmospheric pressure. 4. VCM purification occurs via a distillation process that separates VCM from high boiling residues containing PCDD/PCDF and other by‐products. These residues and by‐products are typically incinerated or otherwise destroyed, and, in some cases, HCl produced during destruction is recovered and recycled. 5. PVC production entails polymerization of VCM to produce PVC resin by one of four routes ‐ suspension, dispersion/emulsion, solution or bulk (mass) – with suspension as the predominant route. In suspension and dispersion polymerization, water is the reaction medium. Solution polymerization is 308",

In bulk polymerization, VCM itself is the reaction medium until the polymer precipitates and absorbs remaining monomer. The reaction finishes as polymerization in the solid polymer. PCDD/PCDF formation in the oxychlorination process is well‐acknowledged. However, PCDD/PCDF are also known to occur in thermal or combustion processes of the EDC/VCM/PVC production chain. The following waste streams from the EDC, VCM and PVC production chain are among those that potentially contain PCDD/PCDF and/or release PCDD/PCDF to one or more vectors: • Stack gases from vent and liquid/vent combustors, HCl furnaces, and, if allowed, flares (USEPA 2012); • Treated wastewater, which is discharged to surface waters, and wastewater treatment residue (sludge), which is commonly sent to landfills or to on‐site or off‐site thermal oxidizers or combustors; • Liquid residues from the oxychlorination process, which are generated at the rate of 25‐40 kg/t VCM (EU IPPCB 2003), and are commonly sent to on‐site or off‐site thermal oxidizers or combustors; • Spent fixed‐bed oxychlorination catalyst, which is generated at rates of 10 to 200 g/t VCM in plants using this technology (EU IPPCB 2003). This material may be landfilled, although some manufacturers subject the catalyst to a thermal treatment to destroy organics associated with the solid support; • Fluidized‐bed oxychlorination catalyst, which undergoes attrition so that small particles are carried over to product vapor and washed out in quench water that is sent to wastewater treatment where the catalyst is captured in wastewater treatment residues; • Coke, which is generated during EDC pyrolysis and removed at a rate of 0.1‐0.2 kg/t VCM (EC 2003); • Spent lime, which is used in some plants for VCM neutralization (EC 2003); • Maintenance waste, which includes a lengthy list of materials such as process filter media, used activated carbon, packing/saddles from scrubbers, incinerator solids, solids from various process streams, etc. (Vinyl Institute 2002).

In 2011, the results of the testing program were reported based on 2008/2009 data (Vinyl Chloride Producers 2011). The results demonstrated that each plant individually met the EU BREF limits. Summed across the 11 EDC/VCM plants tested25, the total release to water was 0.028 g I‐TEQ/day, in comparison to the value of 0.049 g I‐TEQ/day that can be calculated using the EU BREF (0.1 ng TEQ/L) BAT and the wastewater release rate. This emission (0.028 g I‐TEQ/day) is noted as a maximum emission, utilizing the highest flow rate for process water, a highly variable stream.

Residues of greatest interest include process residues, wastewater treatment sludge, spent catalyst, and maintenance waste. Wastewater treatment sludge is reported to account for 26‐33 percent of total PCDD/PCDF release from EDC/VCM/PVC production in the U.S.; spent catalyst, 19‐25 percent; and maintenance waste, 12‐20 percent (Vinyl Institute 2002). Little is known about PCDD/PCDF levels in EDC/VCM/PVC process residues in part because they are commonly sent to liquid and liquid/vent thermal oxidizers or to on‐ or off‐site incinerators. This may not always be the case. For example, heavy ends from Iranian EDC/VCM/PVC facilities have reportedly been sent to landfills (Ghaheri and Ghaheri 2007).

Accordingly, the Vinyl Institute developed upper bound emission factors based on the highest release rate per ton of sludge: for the fixed bed catalyst facilities, 0.75 µg I‐TEQ/t EDC (1.5 µg I‐TEQ/t EDC via oxychlorination) and for fluidized bed facilities, 4.0 µg I‐TEQ/t EDC (7.9 µg I‐TEQ/t EDC via oxychlorination).26 Most likely emission factors were also reported for fixed bed oxychlorination reactors (0.19 µg I‐TEQ/t EDC) (0.37 µg I‐TEQ/t EDC via oxychlorination) and fluidized bed reactors (1.96 µg I‐ TEQ/t EDC) (3.9 µg I‐TEQ/t EDC via oxychlorination) (Table II.48.3).

Spent catalyst: EDC/VCM/PVC and EDC/VCM production generates spent catalysts as residues from EDC production by both direct chlorination and oxychlorination processes. Of these two the oxychlorination catalyst is most significant for PCDD/PCDF (EU IPPCB 2003). Oxychlorination: The oxychlorination process is carried out in either fluidized‐bed or fixed‐bed reactors using a metal catalyst, typically copper chloride: 26 The Vinyl Institute report estimated 1995 EDC production was 11,115,000 t. This is divided approximately equally between direct chlorination and oxychlorination. For oxychlorination, the report estimates that 5,400,000 t of EDC was produced at plants operating fixed bed technology and 5,600,000 t EDC produced at plants operating fluidized bed technology. The report characterized emission factors on the basis of total EDC production; however, in recent years, because the oxychlorination process is a much larger potential generator of PCDD/PCDF than the direct chlorination process, the convention has become to express emission factors associated with EDC in terms of oxychlorination production (OSPAR 2009). Thus, the values in the table are derived from the Vinyl Institute report, but metrics are converted from tons EDC production to tons oxychlorination production (emission factors multiplied by 2), on the assumption that half the EDC production is due to oxychlorination and PCDD/PCDF emission is attributed to that half. 316\n\nFacility type | PCDD/PCDF content (μg I‐TEQ/t sludge) | | Emission Factor (μg I‐TEQ/t EDC by oxychlorination or PVC) | | Range | Average (Median) | Most likely | Upper bound PVC only | 2.8 ‐ 5.5 | 3.9 (3.9)A | 0.023B |",

The disparity in their results was attributed to the use of different production methods, which were not described. Liu et al. (2012) determined PCDD/PCDF concentrations in choranil samples from three other Chinese facilities, each of which used a production process involving the chlorination of hydroquinone. However, at each facility, the chloranil was purified to a different extent because of different intended uses. Chloranil produced for use as an intermediate in pharmaceutical products was most stringently purified and had a PCDD/PCDF concentration of 163 pg I‐TEQ/g. PCDD/PCDF was found at 1,540,200 pg I‐TEQ/g in the chloranil intended for use as an intermediate for dyes and pesticides. A PCDD/PCDF concentration of 26,368 pg I‐TEQ/g was measured in moderate quality chloranil. Liu et al. (2012) proposed the average of these three values, 522,000 μg I‐TEQ/t, as EF for chloranil. Total PCB levels in the three chloranil Product samples ranged from 1,179.4 to12,413.7 pg/g (1.9‐3.3 pg WHO‐TEQ/g); pentachlorobenzene (PeCBz) ranged from 12.1 to 31.8 ng/g; and HCB from 3.8 to 391.5 ng/g. No information is available to support the derivation of emission factors for releases to air, water, land and residue for chloranil.

There are 655 refineries worldwide, located in 116 countries that collectively have a daily capacity of about 88 million barrels per day (b/d).27 Because of the high capacity, many of the units operate continuously, as opposed to processing in batches, at steady state or nearly steady state for months to years. There are three broad categories of refining processes: 1. Separation: The oil is separated into its constituents by distillation, and some of these components (such as the refinery gas) are further separated with chemical reactions and by using solvents that dissolve one component of a mixture significantly better than another. 2. Conversion: The various hydrocarbons produced are then chemically altered to make them more suitable for their intended purpose. Prior to conversion, sulfur must be removed from the hydrocarbons because these reactions often require catalysts that are deactivated by sulfur. 3. Purification: The hydrogen sulfide gas that was extracted from the refinery gas is converted to sulfur, which is sold in liquid form to fertiliser manufacturers. Detailed descriptions of refinery processes can be found in the European Commission’s Integrated Pollution Prevention and Control (IPPC) Reference Document on Best Available Techniques for Mineral Oil and Gas Refineries (EC 2003). Release to Air For catalytic reforming units, off‐gas was reported to have a PCDD/PCDF concentration of 131 ng I‐ TEQ/Nm3 (Jansson 1999).

The average wastewater generation from a large, centralized industrial U.S. dyeing facility is estimated at between 3.8 and 7.5 million liters per day (one and two million gallons per day). Dyeing and rinsing processes for disperse dyeing generate about 100‐140 L of wastewater per kg of product (12‐17 gallons of wastewater per pound). Similar processes for reactive and direct dyeing generate even more wastewater, about 125‐170 L of wastewater per kg of product (15‐20 gallons per pound of product) (USEPA 1997). Based on the analyses of 16 samples from Germany, it was concluded that, the PCDD/PCDF concentration will not increase significantly during these finishing processes: mean concentrations found in finished cotton were at 0.21±0.10 ng I‐TEQ/kg with a median of 0.20 ng I‐TEQ/kg (Horstmann 1994).These results were confirmed by random sample analyses of raw and pre‐treated cotton arriving at the Hamburg harbor, which contained 0.03‐0.2 ng I‐TEQ/kg (Hutzinger et al. 1995). Whereas there are many data for PCDD/PCDF concentrations in final products (textiles), there are no data for residues and wastewater. Therefore, emission factors can be given only as upper bound and lower bound limits for the final product. Release to Air In the only study of PCDD/PCDF air emissions from textile production processes that could be found, the following five processes were investigated (Sedlak et al. 1998): • Crosslinker finish with MgCl , as catalyst; 2 • Flame retardant finish on fleece on the basis of Sb 0 /Hexabromocyclododecane; 2 3 • Flame retardant finish on upholstery material on the basis of ammonium bromide; • Flame retardant finish on fleece on the basis of ammonium bromide; and • Flame retardant finish on upholstery",

PCDD/PCDF concentrations in air emissions from these processes were low, ranging from 1.7 to 2.6 pg TEQ/m3. However, relatively high concentrations of PXDD/PXDF were found in associated textiles and in chimney deposits. Data are not sufficient to derive emission factors. Release to Water Only one study was found in which the PCDD/PCDF content of textile production wastewater was determined. In this study, a PCDD/PCDF concentration of 0.44 ng TEQ/L was measured in wastewater from a Slovenian textile‐dyeing facility engaged primarily in wet‐process dying of polyester yarns with disperse dyes (Marechal et al. 2012).

For example, 244 ng I‐TEQ/kg were detected in bleached polyester, 370 ng I‐TEQ/kg in blue cotton (Horstmann 1994), and 86 ng I‐ TEQ/kg in wool (Mayer 1997). The homologue profiles of all highly contaminated samples were dominated by the higher chlorinated PCDD and PCDF (Cl and Cl ), which are indicators for PCP or 7 8 chloranil‐based dyes and pigments as the source of the contamination. However, several analyses confirmed that there is no correlation between PCP and PCDD/PCDF concentrations in textiles although the congener patterns gave strong indications that PCP should be the source. These findings make sense as PCP is water‐soluble and will be removed in the finishing process and final washing processes whereas the PCDD/PCDF adsorb to the fiber and will stay in the textile (Horstmann and McLachlan 1995b, Klasmeier and McLachlan 1997). The problem of PCDD/PCDF contamination of textiles is not yet resolved, as evidenced by a recent Swedish study that found textiles and leather to account for 90‐95% of total PCDD/PCDF in source‐ separated combustible domestic waste (Hedman et al. 2007). EF of 100 μg TEQ/t is presented as a reasonable upper limit value, based on values reported in Product existing studies.

In addition to carrying chemicals directly required for or generated by leather production processes, leather production wastes also contain chemicals that are incidental to those processes, such as biocides. For example, in the analysis of eleven organochlorine biocides in raw hides from Europe, America and ten Africa countries, none were found in the European and American hides but one or more were found in 63% of the African hides (Font and Marsal 1998). Indeed, lindane and its residues were found in 56% of the African samples, with concentrations as high as 258 mg/kg. It is evident, however, that other organochlorines occur in European leather production. For example, three different chlorophenols, some at concentrations as high as 500 mg/kg, were measured in “wet blue” leather samples from Italy (Favaro et al. 2008). HCB was detected at a concentration of 3.3 μg/L in a composite sample of wastewater discharged from 100 small and big leather industrial units in India (Kumar et al. 2008). These three studies suggest that organochlorines may be common, if not ubiquitous, contaminants in the wastewater, wastewater treatment sludge and other solid wastes of leather production. Leather wastes have high calorific values (4500‐5000 kcal/kg). However, they also have salt content as high as 2.5% (Ozgunay et al. 2007), and, as indicated earlier, potentially significant levels of organochlorine chemicals. Both sources of chlorine – salt and organochlorine chemicals – may exacerbate PCDD/PCDF formation and release if such wastes are incinerated. For example, combustion of footwear leather waste in a semi‐pilot scale incinerator was accompanied by PCDD/PCDF concentrations of 0.841 and 0.355 ng TEQ/Nm3 in the flue gas (Godinho et al. ",

For example, combustion of footwear leather waste in a semi‐pilot scale incinerator was accompanied by PCDD/PCDF concentrations of 0.841 and 0.355 ng TEQ/Nm3 in the flue gas (Godinho et al. 2009). In contrast to textiles, once PCDD/PCDF‐contaminated PCP is applied to leather, neither PCDD/PCDF nor PCP is easily removed by washing processes. In leather “breast‐wallets” concentrations of PCDD/PCDF up to 430 ng I‐TEQ/kg, in leather shoes up to 6,400 ng I‐TEQ/kg were found (Malisch 1994). Although in many countries, the use of PCP has decreased, at least in shoes, the PCDD/PCDF concentrations did not decrease and in Germany, peak concentrations of 2,100 and 3,000 ng I‐TEQ/kg were detected in leather shoes bought in 1991. In the year 1996, highly elevated concentrations continued to exist (Klasmeier and McLachlan 1997). For leather goods, the PCP concentrations correlate with PCDD/PCDF concentrations at least qualitatively. The homologue and congener profiles and patterns strongly indicate that PCP is the source of the dioxin contamination. The continued use of PCP is evidenced by a case in Germany in which a PCP concentration of >2000 mg/kg was found in a leather jacket, following the discovery of high PCP levels in the plasma of a child and her parents (Heudorf et al. 2003). In 2007, Hedman et al. (2007) found that leather and textiles accounted for 90‐95% of total PCDD/PCDF in source‐separated combustible domestic waste in Sweden. A more detailed discussion of leather production processes can be found in the BAT&BEP Guidelines. 333",

In category 8b Crematoria, open air cremations have been explicitly introduced in class 2. Derivation of emission factors 8a Drying of Biomass Release to Air Measured concentrations in air ranged from 0.005 ng I‐TEQ/Nm³ to 3.51 ng I‐TEQ/Nm³ with a median of 0.16 ng I‐TEQ/Nm³ (LUA 1997). The very high concentration was found when PCP‐treated wood was used as a fuel for drying of green fodder. Release in Products Concentrations in the product, e.g., virgin wood are close to detection limit, around 0.1 ng I‐TEQ/kg and for fodder, concentrations as being found in biomonitoring studies with Welsh rye grass can be used. The concentrations found in the dried product, when contaminated wood was used as a fuel, were between 0.3 and 0.8 ng I‐TEQ/kg d.m. An emission factor of 0.5 μg I‐TEQ/t should be applied if PCP‐ treated wood is the fuel and an emission factor of 0.1 μg I‐TEQ/t will be applied if clean fuel is used (LUA 1997). Release to Residues Emission factors for residues have been developed based on expert judgment and analogy with category 8c Smoke houses. 8b Crematoria Release to Air Kim et al. (2003) reported air emissions from 0.46 to 2.1 ng TEQ/Nm³ from Korean crematoria corresponding to an emission factor of 8.4 μg TEQ/body cremated. In Thailand, PCDD/PCDF concentrations were measured in flue gas and bottom ashes from a crematory that had a refractory‐ lined primary combustion chamber and a secondary combustion chamber with an afterburner. Both chambers were fired with light fuel‐oil.

      "text": "Toolkit for Identification and Quantification of Releases of Dioxins, Furans and Other Unintentional POPs January 2013 A national monitoring program of air pollutant releases from crematoria, including PCDD/PCDF, was carried out in France in 2005 (Livolsi et al. 2011). Results show that: • PCDD/PCDF concentrations in flue gas generally ranged from 0.1 to less than 1 ng I‐TEQ/m³. However, a high concentration of 4.18 ng I‐TEQ/m³ was found at one crematorium. This exceptional ly high emission could not be explained. • For crematoria, PCDD/PCDF concentrations in flue gas are higher than the air emission limit value for municipal solid waste incinerators (0.1 ng I‐TEQ/Nm3). Factors that influence dioxin emissions from crematoria could not be identified. Release to Water Normally, wet scrubbers or water quenching are not used at crematoria and thus, no discharges to water will occur. If wet scrubbers are used, the wastewater may end up in local sewer systems or be discharged without any prior treatment. In Western Europe, APC systems are commonly wastewater‐ free because the wastewater is evaporated internally. Release to Land There are no releases to land. Release in Products There are no products generated. Release in Residues Poor combustion conditions will result in poor burn‐out of the organic carbon and in higher concentrations in the fly ash and furnace ash. PCDD/PCDF concentrations in the bottom ashes collected from a crematory in Thailand were 44 and 48 ng I‐TEQ/kg of bottom ash (UNEP 2001, Fiedler et al. 2002). However, insufficient data are available to provide an emission factor. 8c Smoke Houses Release to Air PCDD/PCDF concentrations in off‐gases from smoke houses have been published from Germany (LAI 1995).

The information used to revise the emission factors is presented below, in the respective sections. Derivation of emission factors 9a Landfills, Waste Dumps and Landfill Mining Release to Air On average, 1 ton of normal municipal waste in a landfill generates 150 m³ of landfill gas (European waste) during a period of 10‐20 years (or even longer). The highest gas production normally takes place in the early years after disposal. Measurements of landfill gas have not produced any quantifiable PCDD/PCDF concentrations. However, PCDD/PCDF have been detected in flares and exhausts of gas‐ fired motors (see source category 3c Landfill and Biogas Combustion). No measurable PCDD/PCDF release to air is expected from this activity. Release to Water The leachate or seepage from landfills and dumps can contain PCDD/PCDF. From a Korean industrial waste landfill, Jin et al. (2007) reported a PCDD/PCDF concentration range of 0‐31.17 μg TEQ/m3 in a leachate sample described as “water”, indicating analysis of the aqueous phase. In the U.S., Litten et al., (2003) reported an average PCDD/PCDF concentration of 0.32 pg/L in treated landfill leachate, which were analyzed in conjunction with numerous other aqueous samples. Hiraoka et al. (1993) found PCDD/PCDF concentrations ranging from 0.076 to 6.3 ng/l (> 0.05 ng TEQ/L) in landfill leachates that had undergone biological treatment, coagulation and sedimentation, sand filtration, and/or activated carbon adsorption. In a Spanish study leachate from eight different landfills contained 1.6‐ 1520 pg I‐ TEQ/L (Casanova et al. 1994).

Release to Land Contamination of land can result from poorly controlled dumps and landfills. Release in Products There is no product. Release in Residues There is no residue. However, with the presence of PCDD/PCDF, landfills may serve as a reservoir and a potential source in the future. PCDD/PCDF concentrations in municipal solid waste29 have been reported to range from less than 1 ng I‐TEQ/kg to levels of 100 ng I‐TEQ/kg, and peak concentrations several orders of magnitude higher (especially when dust fractions are present). In Germany, a mean concentration of 50 ng I‐TEQ/kg was estimated from wastes sampled in the late 1980s (Wilken et al. 1992). In the UK, a mean concentration of 6 ng I‐TEQ/kg was measured in the mid 1990s. In a recent study in Italy, PCDD/PCDF concentrations in MSW were ranging from 1.6 to 44 ng TEQ/kg (Grosso et al. 2012).

In addition, the use of chlorine for disinfection of treated effluents can increase PCDD/PCDF concentrations by as much as 50‐fold: a PCDD/PCDF concentration of 0.006 pg TEQ/L was measured in treated effluent that had not been subject to chlorine disinfection, while a PCDD/PCDF content of 0.3 pg TEQ/L was determined in treated effluent that had undergone chlorine disinfection (Pujadas et al. 2001). Release to Land Sludge from sewage treatment may be applied to land to improve soil quality and as a management approach for sewage sludge. If so, the EF will be used for the EF . Product Land Release in Products Sludge may be considered a product when it is applied to land as a soil improvement or is marketed for such use. In these cases it will be considered a release to land. Sludge otherwise disposed of will be accounted for as a release in residues. Here, sewage sludge is the product and there is no residue generated. Release in Residues PCDD/PCDF concentrations in sewage sludge have been measured since the late 1980s, when Hagenmaier found an average concentration of 200 ng TEQ/kg d.m. from 43 German sewage sludge treatment plants (Hagenmaier 1988). Subsequently, about 300 plants were analyzed to give an average of 50‐60 ng TEQ/kg d.m. (Butzkamm‐Erker and Mach 1990). In 30 Swiss sewage plants, Rappe et al.

Example of inventory updating and revision triggered by changes in emission factors This example illustrates the inventory updating and revision for a single source class – open burning of domestic waste ‐ which is triggered by the revision of the emission factor in the Toolkit methodology. Let’s consider a hypothetical inventory of country X. The baseline inventory is developed in 2005, based on data collected for the reference year 2003 and by using the Toolkit 2005 methodology. The baseline inventory estimates that approximately 60,000 tons of domestic waste from rural and urban areas is burned in 2003. The total annual releases of the baseline year are calculated based on the Toolkit 2005 methodology, by applying an emission factor for air of 300 µg TEQ/t of material burnt. The baseline releases to air from open burning of domestic waste are thus estimated at 18 g TEQ/year. Baseline PCDD/PCDF released to air in 2003 (g TEQ/year)= Quantity of waste burnt x EF = Air 60’000 t/yr x 300 µg TEQ/t= 18 g TEQ/year Country X implements measures to reduce releases from open burning as part of the action plan within the National Implementation Plan, and initiates an update of the PCDD/PCDF inventory to assess the success of these measures and report them as part of the national report under Article 15. The updated inventory is developed in 2013, based on data collected for the reference year 2010 and the Toolkit methodology as revised in 2013. 2010 activity rates for this source were assessed at around 20,000 tons of domestic waste burned annually. The corresponding emission factor was revised since the first inventory and is much lower than the one used for the baseline inventory: EF is now 40 µg Air TEQ/t of material burned. The total annual releases are calculated based on the Toolkit 2013 methodology as below: Updated PCDD/PCDF released to air in 2010 (g TEQ/year)= Quantity of waste burnt x EF = Air 20’000 t/yr x 40 µg TEQ/t= 0.8 g TEQ/year The total releases to air from open burning of domestic wast 20 are thus estimated at 0.8 g TEQ/year in 2010",

We’ll take the example of another source group: waste incineration. The baseline inventory of country X mentions that the incineration of animal carcasses is rarely applied in the country and information for this source category is not available. It is thus considered that releases from this source category are negligible in 2003. With the updating of the inventory in 2013, country X discovers that one old facility exists that is specialized in thermal destruction of carcasses. The activity rate for 2010 (the reference year in the updated inventory) is estimated at 1’000 t carcasses destroyed. The emission factor applied is of 500 µg TEQ/t, corresponding to old facilities without air pollution control system. The overall emissions to air from this source category amount to 0,5 g TEQ/year.

Example of baseline inventory using national waste combustion statistics as a major activity data source This example illustrates the inventory process in the case where activity data are mainly obtained through national waste combustion statistics (questionnaires are partially used/targeted to obtain detailed information on incineration technologies in place). The example provides information on the baseline inventory process only, and is mainly focused to providing useful guidance on estimating activity rates. Country X prepared its first inventory of dioxins and furans in 2006 to support the development of the action plan as required by Article 5 of the Convention. Activity data for the different sources of PCDD/PCDF were collected for the reference year 2004 (baseline year). The inventory is developed by applying the Toolkit 2005 methodology and the emission factors specified in that version of the Toolkit. Activity data was obtained from waste incineration national statistics. According to waste statistics, in 2004 350,000 tons of wastes of more than 50 types were incinerated. Greatest incinerated volumes are communal‐domestic wastes, wood wastes without pollution (‘clean’ wood wastes), polluted wood wastes, petrochemical sludge, wastes from paint production, waste petroleum oils, old tires, wastes from chipboard production, wastes from resins production, old sleepers impregnated with creosote, rags polluted with oils, old containers from pesticides, polluted paper and cardboard, liquid spirits, washing waters from chemical production and petroleum products storage, and hospital wastes. For the quantification of PCDD/PCDF emissions, these major categories of combusted wastes were aggregated into different categories according to the Toolkit classification. It was thus accounted that 60,000 tons of wastes are ‘Municipal solid wastes’, 50,000 tons ‘Hazardous wastes’, 5,000 tons ‘Medical wastes’, and 70,000 tons ‘Waste wood and waste biomass’. No incineration of sewage sludge, light fraction shredder wastes and animal carcasses was accounted for. Among these waste types, 10,000 tons of old tyres were combusted in cement kilns; PCDD/PCDF emissions from this category were accounted for in Group 4 – Mineral products. 100000 tons of ‘clean’ wood wastes and 40,000 tons of biomass waste were inc",

It was found that most of the industrial waste and partially medical wastes are incinerated ‘on‐site’, by the plant/hospital generating these wastes. As for municipal wastes, these are incinerated at special plants. Through the analysis of the questionnaires it was found that waste incineration practices include simple types of incineration furnaces, mostly batch‐type. It was thus concluded that most of the waste combustion installations are equipped with simple abatement devices (1‐stage with afterburners, cyclones, scrubbers), which correspond to Class 2 of the Toolkit. Only a minor part of incineration facilities are equipped with 2‐stages abatement systems including bagfilters; this corresponds to Class 3 of the Toolkit. Finally, some facilities do not have abatement at all (Class 1). There is no special management of residues from waste burning and fly ash: these are collected and landfilled together with other industrial and municipal wastes. According to these data, baseline estimates of PCDD/PCDF emission from this source group amounted to: • Air emission: 54.9 g/TEQ, • Emission to residues: 58.6 g/TEQ II.

The emission factor applied is 50 µg TEQ/t, corresponding to old facilities with limited air pollution control. The overall emissions to air from this source category amount to 0.05 g TEQ/year: PCDD/PCDF released to air in 2010 (g TEQ/year)= Quantity of carcasses x EF = Air 1,000 t/yr x 50 µg TEQ/t= 0.05 g TEQ/year The immediate conclusion would be an increase in air emission from 0 to 0.05 g TEQ from 2004 to 2010. However, this particular source was equally present in country X in 2004 but not assessed in the baseline inventory because of lack of information. Consequently, the first inventory must be revised taking into account this new information. The results obtained for this source category in 2004 and 2010 can be compared only after the baseline release estimate has been revised. Revision of the baseline inventory The revision of the baseline inventory is necessary to ensure consistency of trends in releases over time. In this example, only the estimates for one source category pertaining to the waste incineration group need to be revised. 1g Destruction of animal carcasses With the updating of the inventory in 2013, country X discovers new information about thermal destruction of animal carcasses which must be incorporated in the baseline inventory. This source was not accounted in the reference year 2004 due to lack of information. The developer of the inventory needs to assess retrospectively the activity rate of this source for the baseline year to enable the comparison of 2004 and 2010 release estimates. The activity rates for the baseline year are re‐estimated at 1’500 t, and revised release estimates calculated as below: PCDD/PCDF released to air in 2004 (g TEQ/year)= Quantity of carcasses x EF = Air 1’500 t/yr x 50 µg TEQ/t= 0.075 g TEQ/year The results show thus a decrease by 33% in releases to air from this category.

This case study provides a hypothetical example for a Country X, including practical details on updating of the inventory to assess the evolution of emissions further to implementing strict measures as specified in the action plan developed as part of the NIP. The case study also includes essential information on the process of revision of the baseline inventory, which is triggered by revision of emission factors in the Toolkit and discovery of new information on sources which existed in the baseline but were not accounted for due to lack of proper information at that time, allowing to refine the baseline estimates and obtain comparable results. Baseline inventory The baseline inventory of country X was conducted in 2006 using data collected for the 2004 reference year, according to the 2005 Toolkit methodology. Using the following information sources, a list of relevant activity types and facility names was produced: 1. Listings of industrial activities in the Associations representing the sector, 2. Customs databases for imports of inputs for the foundry industry, 3. Industrial activities listed in trade guides for product offers, 4. Local authorities (Districts, Municipalities) and national government (Ministry for Environment). Based on the questionnaire for Group 2 – Ferrous and Non‐Ferrous Metal Production (Annex 3 of the Toolkit), an adapted questionnaire was developed and sent by e‐mail or via fax in 2006, to the list of industries obtained. The heads of each company were requested to complete the necessary information and the activity data for reference year 2004. Of the twelve categories of sources in this group, only four are relevant to the country in the 2004 baseline year, and are detailed below: • 2c Iron and steel production and foundries, • 2d Copper production, • 2e Aluminum production, • 2l Thermal wire reclamation. In 2006 no information was available on activity levels and technologies for the metals smelting sector. To overcome this, the questionnaire was sent to all industries identified, a total of 11. All of them are engaged in secondary smelting of different materials with different qualities, as Country X has not developed primary production of metals from ores. 355",

The facilities visited were those with activities considered as more sensitive in the estimates of PCDD/PCDF emissions, either by the level of activity or the production and control technologies used. The companies selected covered between 80 and 85% of total ferrous and non ferrous production, so this helped to improve the confidence of the emissions estimates in this sector. Open burning of stolen cables from power and telephone lines is an informal activity which frequently takes place in the country. The allowed recovery technology is the peeling of wire for subsequent entry into smelting furnaces, without PVC or other plastic materials. The informal activity is performed in poor conditions. The stolen wire amount in 2004 was obtained from the electricity transmission companies and from the telephone companies. 2c Iron and Steel Production and Foundries In this subcategory a total of five facilities were identified, among which two produce a total of 120,000 tons of liquid steel a year, and three were iron foundries with a production of 30,000 tons per year.

This will lead to an overestimation of the emissions which is however found acceptable due to lack of other information. It is estimated that a total of 600 tons of cables were burned in the open in 2004. This is based on the length of stolen wire and weight per kilometer (kg/km), as provided by electricity transmission companies and phone companies.

The baseline inventory was updated in 2013 to assess whether the implementation of such measures was successful. The Toolkit as revised in 2013 was used as a basis for updating release estimates. The update served to assess both the changes in volumes and types of activity taking place in the country, as well as the effectiveness of measures implemented to reduce levels of emissions. The measures implemented to reduce the PCDD/PCDF emissions from other source categories, in particular waste management, and the rising value of metals on the market, has led to an increase in waste recycling and increasing rates of metal scrap recovery, mainly ferrous. In addition, during the baseline survey performed in 2006 to produce the baseline inventory, several gaps in information were detected. Therefore the Government decided to require registration of smelting activities through the Ministry of Environment. Through this government decision, companies are obliged to update their information every four years. Due to this initiative, necessary information was readily available for processing, and the time needed to update the inventory was significantly reduced.

Conclusion When updating the PCDD/PCDF inventory, it is necessary to review the baseline/previous inventories, due to a number of reasons: • The Toolkit is regularly updated (emission sources and emission factors). • The identification of additional sources in the updated inventory, for which information was not yet available at the time the previous inventories were conducted. • The improvement of the estimates of activity rates in some complex categories, requiring a review of previous inventory estimates. This is not specifically addressed in this case study. The process to update and, when necessary, revise the inventory is essential to guarantee the comparability among results and establishing trends over time. Data quality and confidence in inventory results can be improved by site visits using a limited number of significant facilities. It is worth to include those facilities which have the potential to contribute more to the inventory, i.e. large facilities contributing to a large part of the overall production of the sector. Finally, the process of collecting information for the inventory updating helps to identify gaps and inconsistencies in available information. This offers the opportunity for a practical analysis and a chance to improve and implement better mechanisms for collecting reliable information that may decrease the time needed in future updates and improve the quality of past estimates through revision of previous inventories to fill such gaps. 364",

We will consider a hypothetical example of a PCDD/PCDF inventory in country X, and describe the baseline inventory process, its update and revision for this particular source group. Baseline inventory The total share of fuels in indigenous energy production in country X can be broken down as follows: 55% from hard coal, 37% from brown coal and the remaining 8% comes from gas, oil and hydro. Hard coal is thus the basic fossil fuel burned in households not only for heating, but also for cooking. National activity statistics for the baseline reference year (2001) provide the following consumption figures: • hard coal 174,338 TJ • lignite 980 TJ • high methane natural gas 110,658 TJ • nitrified natural gas 16,953 TJ • LPG 20,812 TJ • light fuel oil 17,496 TJ By grouping the fuels according to type (solid, liquid, gaseous) we obtain the following figures: • coal 175,318 TJ • oil 17,496 TJ • natural gas 148,423 TJ 3e Household Heating and Cooking with Fossil Fuels One of the main sources of PCDD/PCDF releases in country X comes from combustion processes in household boilers and furnaces, where commercial fuels are frequently co‐combusted with household waste. The municipal and housing sector has a dominant share in PCDD/PCDF emissions, as the main fuel used in this sector is hard coal, with an annual consumption of 9 million tons. The 2003 Toolkit applies an emission factor for burning of coal in residential heating systems of 70 μg I‐ TEQ/TJ corresponding to approximately 2 μg I‐TEQ/t. The default emission factor was derived from mean values reported between 1.6 and 50 μg I‐TEQ/t of coal burned. Several recent measurements indicate that the emission from the residential burning of coal in country X may be much higher. These results indicate that the emission factor for residential burning of coal ‐ even though the coal is not co‐combusted with waste ‐ may be significantly higher than the default emission factor of the 365",

The default emission factor is still used as a medium estimate, but it is estimated that the real average emission factor is likely to be higher rather than lower, and a range of 35‐1,000 μg I‐TEQ/t will be applied. The resulting annual releases to air are presented in the table below: Source category Source Class Activity rate EF Annual release to air (g Air TJ/year µg I‐TEQ/t TEQ/a) Medium (Toolkit Range Medium Range 2003) Domestic heating Coal fired 219,484 70 30‐1,000 15 6.6‐200 and cooking – stoves fossil fuels Update of the inventory In 2008, new emission factors are published in country X based on specific measurements of emissions from coal fired stoves. These country‐specific factors are then used with higher confidence to update the inventory. Activity rates are comparable with those estimated for the baseline year, and are equally derived from national statistics, as in the baseline inventory.

This is clearly due to applying a different set of emission factors, which were derived to better reflect the national circumstances in country X. Revision of the baseline inventory The revision of the baseline inventory is thus necessary to ensure consistency of trends in releases over time. In this example, the revision is triggered by scientific findings and developments, allowing country X to re‐calculate releases by using an own set of emission factors developed to better reflect national circumstances.

We will consider a hypothetical example of an inventory of country X, and describe the inventory process focusing on the source group 4 Mineral Products. Baseline inventory Let’s consider a hypothetical inventory of country X. The baseline inventory is developed in 2006, based on data collected for the reference year 2005 and by using the Toolkit 2005 methodology. The baseline inventory estimated that approximately 15,000 tons of bricks were manufactured each year based from statistical data obtained from the manufacturing industry. The technologies used in the manufacturing industry have no dust control systems in place and do NOT use contaminated fuels. The total annual releases for the baseline year were calculated based on the Toolkit 2005 methodology, by applying an emission factor for air of 0.2 µg TEQ/t of brick manufactured. The baseline releases to air from brick manufacturing were thus estimated at 0.003 g TEQ/year. Baseline PCDD/PCDF released to air in 2005 (g TEQ/year) = Quantity of bricks manufactured x EF = Air = 15,000 t/yr x 0.2 µg TEQ/t = 0.003 g TEQ/year Update of the inventory The updated inventory is developed in 2013, based on data collected for the reference year 2010 and the Toolkit methodology as revised in 2013. Activity rates for this source had been assessed at around 15,000 tons of bricks produced annually for the baseline year. The corresponding emission factor has been revised since the first inventory and is much lower than the one used for the baseline inventory: EF is now 0.02 µg TEQ/t of brick produced using technologies that have no emission abatement Air technology in place and using non‐contaminated fuels. This is in contrast to 0.2 µg TEQ/t that had previously been used for this technology. In addition in this category, there are new emission factors for Products (0.006 µg TEQ/t) and Residues (0.002 µg TEQ/t).

Revised baseline inventory Based on new statistical data available, it was now possible to estimate the total brick production in the country which will include bricks from commercial production and artisanal brick production as opposed to baseline year which only had data from the commercial manufacturing industries. This will give a better estimate of activity rate arising from this source category. From statistical data 35,000 housing units are built per year and of these, approximately 16% are constructed using bricks. Assuming that each housing unit will use approximately 15,000 bricks and each weighing approximately 2.5kg, the resulting activity rate will be as follows: Calculation of activity rate: Total number of housing units built per year = 35,000 Total number of units built using bricks is 16% of total = 35,000 x 0.16 = 5,600 units Bricks used per unit appx 15,000 and assuming 10% waste = 15,000 + (15,000 x 0.1) = 16,500 bricks Total number of bricks used for 5600 units = 16,500 x 5,600 = 92,400,000 bricks Total tons of bricks produced/yr assuming 2.5kg per brick = 92,400,000 x 2.5/1000 tons = 231,000 tons In determining the activity rates based on construction data, there is a level of uncertainty that is inherent because of use of a uniform size of house unit, assumed identical sizes for both commercial and artisanal bricks and also not taking into consideration other buildings that are not residential units but use bricks for construction . Calculation of release estimates: Revised baseline PCDD/PCDF released to air (g TEQ/year) = Quantity of bricks manufactured x EF = Air = 231,000 t/yr x 0.02 µg TEQ/t = 0.005 g TEQ/year Revised baseline PCDD/PCDF to products (g TEQ/year) = Quantity of bricks manufactured x EF Product",

Conclusion Revising the release levels from this category is advised, since the revised emission factor values in the 2013 Toolkit may affect the release levels by one order of magnitude as compared with those that had been determined using the previous emission factors.

We will consider a hypothetical example of an inventory of country X, and describe the baseline inventory process, its update and revision, focusing on source group 5 Transport. Baseline inventory Country X prepares its first inventory of dioxins and furans in 2006 to support the development of the action plan as required by Article 5 of the Convention and included in the National Implementation Plan pursuant to Article 7. Activity data for the different sources of PCDD/PCDF in country X were collected for the reference year 2004 (baseline year). The inventory is developed by applying the Toolkit 2005 methodology and the emission factors specified in that version of the Toolkit. All four source categories included in this source group are relevant for country X in the baseline year. These are presented below. According to the Toolkit 2005 methodology, activity rates for transport should be expressed as volumes of fuel used by category of fuel and transport. During the process of activity data collection, information on actual amounts of fuel used in the transport sector annually (gasoline, ethanol, diesel fuel, kerosene, residual oil, jet fuel etc.) at the national level was found from the national statistics office. According to these data, in 2004 in country X, 1,000,000 tons of gasoline, 500,000 tons of diesel fuel, 100,000 tons of heavy fuel (residual) oil, 50,000 tons of kerosene, 10,000 tons of LPG and 5,000,000 m3 of CNG were used for transportation. The data provides details on quantities of fuel according to fuel type and sector (road transport, railway transport, mobile machinery in agriculture, construction, forest industry etc.). However, no data on distribution of leaded and unleaded gasoline are publicly available; no data on distribution of fuel consumption according to the type of vehicles (4‐stroke and 2‐stroke) and its ecological class (without catalyst and with catalyst) are available. To complement this information and be able to obtain estimates of fuel distribution with a higher degree of confidence, questionnaires have been sent to the main offices and consumers of fuel in the country",

It was thus established that data are available on request on the number of registered vehicles per type of vehicle. Data on the year of production of the registered cars were also obtained, but no account of vehicles by ecological characteristics (with or without catalysts) was available. According to these data obtained by the developer of the inventory, 100,000 tons of leaded gasoline were imported in 2004, but the distribution between 4‐stroke and 2‐stroke vehicles could not be obtained. Questionnaires showed that 2‐stroke vehicles are more often fueled with leaded gasoline in comparison with 4‐stroke vehicles; expert judgment was used to estimate the distribution of leaded gasoline between 4‐stroke and 2‐stroke vehicles; this was assumed to be 80%:20%.

It takes into consideration some of the triggering factors for updating and revision that are specific to this particular source group. Baseline Inventory In country X, open burning processes releasing PCDD/PCDF mainly include biomass burning to clean the fields and domestic waste burning. The baseline inventory of country X is developed in 2006 based on data collected for the reference year 2004. The developer of the inventory found only limited data on activity levels for this sector. Data on forest fires was collected for instance from the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry. Nevertheless, expert judgment was an essential tool to calculate releases from open burning. 6a Biomass burning According to the statistics provided by the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry of country X, three major fire incidents have occurred in 2004, affecting a total of 20’000 hectares of forest. Data from a national forest inventory and analysis program and a number of studies estimating forest biomass in country X using remote sensing and satellite products show that forest biomass density across the country is on average 150 tons/ha. The baseline activity rate for this source class is thus estimated at 3’000’000 tons burnt annually. Secondly, the extent of crop residue burning is very difficult to estimate. The actual amount varies dramatically from year to year, depending upon amounts of rainfall, cropping patterns and weather conditions during and after the harvest season. Some years, burning may take place over quite a long fall season, or even be delayed to the following spring. As such, it is very difficult to estimate the extent of burning in a given year, or to analyze trends. Assumptions are thus needed to quantify the quantity of agricultural residues that are burnt annually. Two assumptions are made by the developer of the inventory, according to a similar study: 1) that the amount of agricultural residue able to be burned was equal to the total crop production, and 2) that 80% of residues were burned in the developing world and 50% of residues were burned in the developed world for any given year. Based on these assumptions, activity rates for agricultural residue burning were estimated at 500’000 tons of material burnt in 2004. Dioxin and furan releases",

Data on domestic waste burning are not readily available in country X. The developer of the inventory therefore needs to estimate activity rates for this sector based on assumptions and expert judgment. The average amount of waste produced in urban areas is of 0.7 kg per capita per day and of 0.5 kg per capita per day in rural areas. From the total amount of waste generated in urban areas, 70% are collected for reuse, incineration or disposal, leaving 30% that can be burned in backyard fires. From the total amount of waste generated in rural areas, it is considered that 20% are burnt in the open, since a greater fraction is used for composting. The estimated amount of domestic waste burnt annually is of 60,000 tons in 2004. The total annual releases are calculated by multiplying this activity rate with the corresponding emission factor. The results are shown in the table below: Source Source Class Activity rate Annual release (g TEQ/a) Total category (t/year) Air Water Land Product Residue Waste Open burining 60,000 18 36 54 burning and of domestic accidental waste fires Update of the inventory Country X implements measures to reduce releases from open burning as part of the action plan within its National Implementation Plan. The measures are based on providing incentives to avoid open burning and manage waste in a more appropriate manner: through education and awareness raising programmes, better infrastructure and enforcement. In 2013, country X initiates an update of the inventory to assess the success of these measures. The activity data used for updating release estimates are collected for the reference year 2010, while the inventory is developed according to the Toolkit methodology as revised in 2013. 6a Biomass burning The 2010 activity data are estimated according to the same approach and using the same expert judgment and assumptions as in the baseline inventory.

This class is newly added in the 2013 version of the Toolkit, and new emission factors were developed and are now available for this very specific source. Agricultural residues and sugarcane residues burnt in 2010 are estimated according to the same assumptions as in the baseline inventory and amount to 300’000 tons and 100’000 tons material burnt respectively. The resulting release estimates are shown below: Source Source Class Activity rate Annual release (g TEQ/a) Total category (t/year) Air Water Land Product Residue Biomass Agricultural 300,000 9 3 11 burning residue burning, poor combustion conditions Sugarcane 100’000 0.4 0.005 0.45 burning Forest fires 2’000’000 2 0.3 2.3 The immediate conclusion after the updating of the inventory would be a drastic reduction in emissions to air from agricultural residue burning (‐40%) and forest fires (‐87%) and an increase from 0 to 2 g TEQ in emissions to air from sugarcane burning. This conclusion would not take into account the fact that the emission factors have equally been revised and are much lower in the 2013 edition of the Toolkit than in the 2005 edition. This has an impact on the resulting estimates of releases, contributing to lower emission values. In addition, the new class of sugarcane burning for which emission factors were not available in the 2005 edition of the Toolkit, will also have to be assessed separately in the baseline inventory, so that the same basis for calculation (and same emission factors) and the same scheme of classification of sources be used for both reference years. 6b Waste burning and accidental fires 2010 activity rates for open burning of domestic waste are calculated by extrapolating per capita waste production to population levels in urban and rural areas, and using the same assumptions concerning the fraction of waste that is burnt in the open in these areas.

This is due to the revision of the respective emission factor e.g., for air, the emission factor was revised from 300 µg TEQ/t to 40 µg TEQ/t. To be able to assess the actual trend in releases over time, a revision of the baseline inventory is thus necessary use the same basis for calculation for both 2004 and 2010 estimates. Revision of the baseline inventory Two triggering factors come into play in this case prompting the need for revision: one is the revision of emission factors in the Toolkit, and the second one is the addition of new source classes to the Toolkit classification. To be able to compare release estimates in 2004 and 2010, the same methodology, the same basis for calculation (the same emission factors) need to be consistently used in the different inventories, along with the same source classification scheme. There is a need to go back to the baseline release estimates for this source group and re‐calculate those estimates according to the same methodology and approach as used in the updated inventory. The revised baseline estimate will be the product of the baseline activity levels and the revised emission factors taken from the Toolkit 2013 methodology. 6a Biomass burning The baseline release estimates are re‐calculated by applying the 2013 set of Toolkit emission factors and the classification of sources put forward in the 2013 version of the Toolkit. From the 400’000 tons of agricultural residues were considered to be burnt in the open in 2004 (the baseline year), 100’000 tons were actually sugarcane residues. As at the time the baseline inventory was developed there were no emission factors available for sugarcane burning, those residues were assessed together with the other agricultural crops. The releases are re‐calculated by including this additional class and applying the emission factors proposed in the Toolkit 2013 methodology: Source Source Class Activity rate Annual release (g TEQ/a) Total category (t/year) Air Water Land Product Residue Biomass Agricultural 300,000 9 3 11 burning residue burning, poor combustion conditions Sugarcane 100’000 0.4 0.005 0.4 burning Forest fires 3’000’000 3 0",

As no new or corrected information has become available that would influence activity level estimates, these are the same as in the 2004 inventory: 60’000 tons of domestic waste burnt annually. The revised baseline release estimates are shown in the table below: Source Source Class Activity rate Annual release (g TEQ/a) Total category (t/year) Air Water Land Product Residue Waste Open burning 60,000 2.4 0.06 2.5 burning and of domestic accidental waste fires The results demonstrate that between 2004 and 2010 there was an actual increase in emissions from 2.5 to 2.9 g TEQ/year. If the baseline estimate was revised by using the same emission factors for the calculation, the conclusion of a reduction in releases from 2004 to 2010 would have been largely amiss. Conclusion The Toolkit emission factors for open burning were significantly revised since the 2005 edition, and new source classes added to the respective categories. These two factors will most likely trigger the need to revise baseline estimates in most cases. In addition, reviewing the approach that was used in the baseline inventory provides useful information on how to estimate activity rates for this source group. Data on open burning is very limited at the country level, and expert judgment will be needed to fill such gaps. Checking the assumptions made in the baseline inventory to estimate activity rates and applying the same assumptions in the updated inventory equally enables obtaining consistent results and coherent trends in releases over time. 380\n\nSource category | Source Class | Activity rate (t/year) | Annual release (g TEQ/a) | | | | | Total ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | | | Air | Water | Land | Product | Residue | Waste burning and accidental fires | Open burning of domestic waste | 60,000 | 2.4 | | 0.06 | | | 2.5",

This case study provides a hypothetical inventory example of a Country X, including practical details on updating and revision of the inventory to assess trends in releases over time. Country X developed the baseline inventory of dioxins in 2004 to support the development of the action plan as required by Article 5 of the Stockholm Convention. Activity data for the different sources of dioxins were collected for the reference year 2004 (baseline year). Activity data were obtained from the statistic yearbook. The inventory is developed by applying the Toolkit 2005 methodology and the emission factors specified in the 2005 edition of the Toolkit. In this sample inventory, the inventory development process for the chemical industry is detailed, and provides useful guidance on estimating PCDD/PCDF releases for this source group. Baseline inventory for source category 7b The baseline inventory of Country X was conducted in 2004 using data collected for the reference year 2004, according to the emission factors included in the Toolkit 2005 methodology. Activity rates For pentachlorophenol (PCP) and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB), the production and use of PCP and PCB had been forbidden in Country X for many years, and thus no production of these chemicals occurred in the baseline year. For PCP‐Na, the output was of 2,000 tons. For chlorinated pesticides, 2,4,‐dichlorophenoxy acetic acid (2,4‐D) and 2,4,6‐trichlorophenol were used as herbicides in Country X. The outputs of 2,4‐D and 2,4,6‐trichlorophenol in Country X in 2004 were of 16,000 and 800 tons respectively. No production of other chemicals listed in category 7b occurred in Country X in the baseline year 2004. For chloranil, there were three plants in Country X in 2004. Plant A produced p‐chloranil via chlorination of phenol. Plant B manufactured p‐chloranil via hydroquinone, and Plant",

About 4.53 million tons of PVC production belonged to class 3 (PVC only). Estimation of dioxins from source 7b in Country X Release estimates were made by assuming a linear relation between the intensity of the activity and the emission resulting from this activity. Release to Air For source 7b, the emission factors to air were only available for class 2 and 3 of the EDC/VCM/PVC in Toolkit 2005 methodology. Releases to air from source 7b were calculated by using the following equation: Release of dioxins to air = = 800 000 t × 0.4 μg TEQ/t (Modern plants, EDC/VCM or EDC/VCM/PVC) + 4 530 000 t × 0.0003 μg TEQ/t (PVC only) = 0.32 g Release to Water For source 7b, the emission factors to water were only available for class 2 and 3 of the EDC/VCM/PVC in Toolkit 2005 methodology.

In particular, releases in product are twice as high as baseline values. This is only due to the changes in the Toolkit emission factors, as the activity rates remained at constant levels since 2004. To ensure consistent results over time, the baseline release estimates need to be revised according to the Toolkit 2013 set of emission factors, ensuring that the difference between the 2010 and 2004 values is, as expected, null. Conclusion New data and information have been integrated in the revised 2013 edition of the Toolkit, and important changes have been made to emission factors and the classification of sources for the chemical industry. The updating of the inventory for this source group needs to be accompanied by the revision of the baseline values to enable assessment of consistent trends in releases over time. 386\n\n| | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | 0.000 | | | | -------------------------------------------------------------------- | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | 0.000 | | | | 1 2 3 4 | | P-Chloranil Direct chlorination of phenol Chlorination of hydroquinone with minimal purification Chlorination of hydroquinone with moderate purification Chlorination of hydroquinone with advanced purification | | | 2'000 | | | 0.000 | | | 0.000 | | | 0.000 | | | 1900.000 | | | 0.000 | | | | | | 1'000 | | | | | | | | | | | | 400.000 | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | 0.000 | | | | | | | | | 1'000 | | | | | | | | | | | | 26.000 | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |",

Further to implementing these measures, country X needs to assess whether PCDD/PCDF releases from this source decreased over time. The inventory is thus updated in 2011 to evaluate the changes in releases as a result of implementing best available techniques and best available practices. Data were collected for 2010 (reference year). During the process of updating the inventory it was found that 20 new crematoria with optimal control for PCDD/PCDF (class 3) release were installed in various regions in country X. Questionnaires were sent to both new and existing crematoria to obtain up‐to‐date information regarding their production or activity rates, temperature and duration of cremation process, fuel use, air pollution control system and evaluate/reclassify these facilities according to their current technology profile and activity levels. The same approach as in the baseline inventory was thus applied and resulted in 30% of the crematoria which were classified as class 1 in the baseline inventory being upgraded to class 2, and 5% of the crematoria which were classified as class 2 in the baseline being upgraded to class 3. The results show that although the number of facilities increased in country X from 2004 to 2010, PCDD/PCDF releases decreased over the same period of time as a result of phasing in best available techniques for crematoria: Activity Annual release (g I‐TEQ/a) Source Categories (t/a) Air Water Land Product Residue 8) Miscellaneous 8b) Crematories 1 No control 99,000 8.91 ND 2 Medium control 152,000 1.52 0.38 3 Optimal control 50,000 0.02 0.12 Total for Crematoria 253,788 10.45 0.5 Country X also plans an own PCDD/PCDF measurement campaign to collect and analyze samples from several facilities and refine the emission factors used in estimating releases",

Once the emission data are generated and new emission factors derived, country X will revise the inventory by applying the same set of revised emission factors based on own measurements, to enable consistent evaluation of trends in releases over time. Conclusion When updating the PCDD/PCDF inventory, it is necessary to review the baseline or previous inventories to maintain consistency over time and ensure that the estimates obtained are comparable over time. Data quality is important; therefore, it is also essential to revise and update data obtained from national statistics, questionnaires and site visits.

II. Source category 8d Dry cleaning Introduction Dioxin and furans emitted by the dry cleaning processes are found in the residues from distillation of the solvents and in filters. The emission factors for PCDD/PCDF found in the literature are usually expressed relative to the amount of residue from the solvent recycling process. Depending on the efficiency of stills, the bottoms range from a dry powder to a wet sludge that contains some solvent and the filtered material. As shown in the Toolkit, a ton of residue from a dry cleaning machine may contain from 50 µg TEQ to 3000 µg TEQ of PCDD/PCDF depending on the nature of the cloths and tissues treated and the amount of contamination they contain. To evaluate releases of PCDD/PCDF from the dry cleaning industry at a country level using the Toolkit method, one has to estimate the amount of residues generated and the relative nature of the tissues cleaned (heavy or contaminated textiles/normal textiles). In nearly all countries it is difficult to find such data to complete the inventory. In case of lacking data, the following considerations may help in the estimation of these values: ‐ In a US EPA study, it was reported that an average dry cleaning machine (16 kg cloths per hour/1890 kg per month) generates an average of 183 kg of residues from the bottom of the still; an approximation of the amount of residues generated might be 1 kg/10 kg of textiles ; ‐ The ratio of heavy textiles to normal textiles treated in dry cleaning laundries is varying from country to country; an expert judgment is needed according to local practices; ‐ Last generation dry cleaning processes use less than 10 kg of solvent per ton of textiles; ‐ Residues of dry cleaning contain less than 1% of solvent (new dry cleaning processes). Example 1 In country A, the total installed dry cleaning capacity is 2500 kg/h and the activity is 3600 t/year of which 60% are heavy textiles. The total amount of residues is estimated at 360 t/year and the PCDD/PCDF releases in residues are: ‐ From heavy textiles",

It is thus important to try to obtain an industry‐based breakdown of the import data. 33 The regulation in US and Canada sets a limit of solvent consumption for dry cleaning to 6.5 l/ton of cloths (10 kg/ton of cloths in the case of perchlorethylene). 390",

For source group 9, data on the amount of wastes deposited on landfills and waste dumps, sewage collection, treatment and disposal were obtained from the National Department of Statistics and from the National Survey on Basic Sanitation, complemented by data from agencies and companies responsible for waste and sewage collection, treatment and disposal. Category 9a Landfills and Waste Dumps To estimate leachate releases generated by organic decomposition of municipal solid waste, the total amount of wastes disposed of in sanitary landfills ‐ 1,011,780 t/year ‐ and in waste dumps – 809,424 t/year – was considered, resulting in a total of 1,821,204 t wastes disposed of per year. Reliable studies were conducted by researchers at the National University in Country A, indicating generation of leachate from 0.1 to 0.2 cubic meter per ton of waste disposed of. Considering the intermediate value of 0.15 m3/t, the total volume of leachate generated in 2005 was of 273,181,000 liters. Information for the calculation of leachate from hazardous waste releases does not exist. The surveyed companies reported that formation of leachate in landfills containing industrial hazardous waste is small, as special landfills are used for this type of waste, compliant with the legislation in force, with low amounts of degradable organic matter, and where rain is prevented from reaching the landfilled waste. Municipal solid wastes are considered to contain 5% of hazardous wastes according to information given by the Federal Environment Agency. The total annual release was then calculated by multiplying the activity rates by the corresponding emission factors according to the Toolkit (2005).

Assuming an all organic fraction in compost, annual releases of PCDD/PCDF are of 1.4 g TEQ/year. Category 9e Waste Oil Treatment (Non‐Thermal) As there is no emission factor for this type of source, no further attempt was made to quantify PCDD/PCDF releases from this source. Total Annual Releases from Source Group 9 The total annual releases of PCDD/PCDF from source group 9 in Country A, in the reference year 2005, amount to 24.4 g TEQ/year. Updating of the inventory Based upon the results of 2005 baseline inventory, Country A introduced a number of measures to reduce releases of PCDD/PCDF. In relation to source group 9, the main actions taken were: a) To reduce by 50% the hazardous content of wastes deposited on landfills and dumps; b) To introduce a recycling program to reduce the amount of landfilled waste per capita. In 2010 the reduction was of 5%; c) To eliminate mixing of industrial inputs into sewage collection and treatment systems. The update of the inventory is described below. Category 9a Landfills and Waste Dumps The same methodology as in the baseline inventory was employed to estimate releases generated by organic decomposition of municipal solid waste. According to the Toolkit 2013, emission factors for category 9a have been revised and the need to estimate the amount of leachate generated by waste decomposition has been eliminated; the emission factors are now based on the amount of solid wastes generated. Also, as a result of measures taken, hazardous wastes contained in domestic wastes reduced by half and there was a 5% reduction on domestic wastes. The updated values are shown in the table below. The results show a decrease of 6.4 g TEQ/year, as compared with the baseline release estimates.

Chlor­alkali production Experience from China, Germany, Sweden and the USA proves that chlor‐alkali processes can generate large quantities of PCDD/PCDF (Weber et al. 2008). Limited data are available on the total PCDD/PCDF production and release in chlor‐alkali plants, but a detailed inventory has been prepared and published for Rheinfelden in Germany (Otto et al. 2006). Griesheim Elektron operated a chlor‐alkali plant at this site starting with 1898 for 87 years. Toxic residues of the chlor‐alkali process together with other industrial waste were disposed of in small gravel pits in the vicinity of the plant without safety measures. In 1989, widespread PCDD/PCDF contamination was discovered in soils (Otto et al. 2006). The analysis demonstrated that PCDF contamination was dominant, and samples revealed peak concentrations of 26,000 ng TEQ/kg in topsoil and up to 3,800,000 ng TEQ/kg in deep soil, comprising mainly of historic sludge deposits. The approach for the inventory at Rheinfelden included: • An investigation of the history of chlorine production and technologies used at the factory and a review of the methods and sites used for the disposal of residues. • A preliminary screening of contamination: in a first phase, 100 locations where sampled with 303 core probes. Forty representative pooled samples were then analysed for PCDD/PCDF, heavy metals, total organics and other site‐specific parameters. • In the second phase it was discovered that heavily contaminated solid residues have been used as infill materials at many sites as the city developed in the 20th century. This resulted in widespread contamination with PCDD/PCDF, heavy metals and other contaminants. The entire inner city area (ca. 290 ha) was assessed. Soil samples from 1615 estates involving 3566 individual drillings were collected and screened. Finally, a soil contamination map of the entire city was developed, showing indicator heavy metals",

A PCDD/PCDF inventory was established based on monitoring data and related assessments, followed by remediation and containment of deposits and contaminated soils. The total amount of PCDD/PCDF residues deposited from the chlor‐alkali plant was estimated at 8.5 kg I‐TEQ (Otto et al. 2006). Furthermore, between 1970 and 1986 the factory also produced PCP and PCP‐Na, and the residues associated with this production were estimated to contain an additional 7.7 kg I‐TEQ (with a total 7 tons of PCDD/PCDF), thus a total PCDD/PCDF contamination of 16.2 kg I‐TEQ (Otto et al. 2006).

In the late 1980s, high levels of arsenic and lead were detected in soil in the vicinity of the site. Subsequent investigations in the 1990s also revealed high levels of PCDF (and PCDD to a lesser extent) (Balzer et al. 2007, 2008). The assessment included historical investigation and archive research to retrieve information on the production site, as well as technical and scientific literature review on the Leblanc process and associated processes. Based on these investigations, a detailed soil analysis was undertaken, with more than 600 soil cores analysed for a range of organic and inorganic contaminants. Approximately 500 samples were also analysed for PCDD/PCDF, confirming that the entire surface and subsurface soil was highly contaminated with PCDD/PCDF and heavy metals. A PCDD/PCDF inventory was thus established based on the levels measured in samples and the volumes of deposited residues and contaminated soils. The total amount of PCDD/PCDF in soils and deposits was of 1‐10 kg TEQ, while the total arsenic and lead contamination was of 12‐ 80 tons and 50‐300 tons respectively (Balzer et al. 2007). Since a range of chemical processes were employed in Leblanc plants, the individual steps and processes were evaluated with respect to their PCDD/PCDF formation potential. Four distinct operational steps with a high PCDD/PCDF formation potential have been identified for the Lampertheim factory (Balzer et al. 2008): a) The direct manganese oxide method was used for chlorine production from HCl. b) The production of calcium hypochlorite (bleaching powder) from elemental chlorine and Ca(OH) in “chlorine chambers”: in these processes, coal tar was used as a filler and 2 protection material, resulting in PCDD/PCDF formation. At Lampertheim, highly contaminated residues with TEQ levels above 200 µg TEQ/kg and waste deposits with levels of 500 µg TEQ/kg were found in the vicinity of the former production area.

The PCDD/PCDF pattern of these residues is similar to those characteristic of the chlor‐alkali process. c) Hydrochloric acid released from the Leblanc process ovens was condensed in coke towers for further processing. PCDD/PCDF contamination in soils where the piping system and the coke towers were located was above 10 µg TEQ/kg. d) Finally, the production of sodium sulphate and sal soda in ”sulphate ovens” and flame ovens, with residues from these thermal processes contaminated with up to 95 ng TEQ/kg. A European survey of Leblanc factories revealed that at least 70 to 100 factories were operated during the 19th century mainly in Great Britain, France and Germany (Balzer et al. 2008). According to historical records, 413,000 tons of sal soda were produced in 1865 via the Leblanc process, with the main producers located in the United Kingdom (234,000 tons), France (108,000 tons) and Germany (66,000 tons). An inventory of former Leblanc sites has only been made in Germany, where 15 locations have been identified (Balzer et al. 2008). At least 30 Leblanc factories have also been operated in France, while in the United Kingdom approximately 30 to 40 Leblanc factories were operational during the mid‐ 19th century. 10b Production Sites of Chlorinated Organics 399",

Chlorophenol production The Finnish Environment Institute has compiled an inventory and risk assessment of PCDD/PCDF contaminated sediments from releases of a polychlorophenol (PxCP) wood preservative Ky‐5. Ky‐5 was manufactured in the upper reaches of the Kymijoki river in South‐Eastern Finland between 1940 and 1984 (Verta et al. 2009). The product consisted mainly of 2,3,4,6‐tetrachlorophenol (83%), pentachlorophenol (8%) and 2,4,6,‐ trichlorophenol (6%). PCDD/PCDF, especially the higher chlorinated dibenzofurans, were major impurities in the product and in residues. The company discharged residues into the river system resulting in highly contaminated sediments with a maximum PCDD/PCDF concentration above 400,000 µg/kg (Verta et al. 1999c). Sediment cores from 220 sites were collected between 1997 and 2003. PCDD/PCDF were analysed from sub‐samples of ten sediment cores, 35 surface sediment samples, 15 locations in the river and ten coastal sites from the Gulf of Finland (Isosaari et al. 2002, Verta et al. 2007). Figure III.11.1 shows the concentration of PCDD/PCDFs in sediments. The total volume of contaminated sediments was estimated to be 5×106 m3 and the hotspot volume amounted to approximately 90,000 m3 of sediments with extremely high concentrations (max. 292,000 µg/kg or 1,060 µg I‐TEQ/kg d.w.). These were located immediately downstream from the factory. The total amount of Ky‐5 chlorphenol‐derived PCDD/PCDF was estimated to be approximately 5,960 kg (17.3 kg I‐TEQ) in the river sediments and 1,770 kg (12.4 kg I‐TEQ) in the Gulf of Finland (Fig. III.11.1; Verta et al. 2009).

Other chemicals known or suspected to contain PCDD/PCDF or other unintentional POPs While the levels of PCDD/PCDF in some products (e.g. pesticides) have been monitored, the levels in production residues are often unknown. To assess occupational safety during the excavation of the Bonfol chemical landfill in Switzerland, a PCDD/PCDF inventory of the deposited waste was compiled. The Basel Chemical Industry34 (BCI) has produced and used a range of chlorinated aromatic compounds not known to be highly contaminated with PCDD/PCDF or precursors (e.g. 2,4‐D, 2,4,5‐T or PCP). Between 1961 and 1976, the industry disposed of 114,000 tons of chemical wastes in the Bonfol landfill, an old clay quarry. Because the landfill contaminated groundwater, BCI was forced to fully remediate the site by excavating and incinerating chemical wastes. For the inventory, the chemicals listed by the German Environmental Agency (UBA) as containing or potentially containing PCDD/PCDF were used as one information source (UBA 1985). This list was supplemented by additional literature on substances containing PCDD/PCDF and PCB (Forter 2005, 2006) including: • Three lists containing approximately 5,000 substances which were produced during 1960‐2003, by BCI. The information included data on educts, production intermediates and products. • Other unpublished internal documents from chemical companies including information on production and synthesis methods, capacity calculations and internal analysis reports. • Newsletters and reports or other publications by companies, chemical associations and further publications. • Analytical results available from samples taken from around disposal sites used by BCI members operating in Switzerland, France, Germany and the USA. • The amended lists and additional information were then discussed with chemists, chemical engineers and laboratory experts at Roche, Sandoz, Geigy, Ciba and Ciba‐Geigy.

PCDD/PCDF wastes were estimated for four of these products: the production of trichlorophenol by Roche and the production of dioxazin pigments and paints, Mitin LA and triclosan by Geigy or Ciba‐Geigy (Forter 2005, 2006) (Table III.11.2). The majority of PCDD/PCDF and PCB impurities from educts and those formed during the production of trichlorophenol, triclosan, Mitin LA and Oxazin/Dioxazin pigments and paints ultimately ended up, by a process of filtration and distillation of the chlorinated solvents, in the residues and were ultimately disposed of at the Bonfol chemical landfill between 1965 and 1975. Considering the PCDD/PCDF quantities resulting from these four production processes, and taking into account that BCI was a heavy user of chlorinated solvents, it was shown that total TEQ levels of several tens of kilogram were present 34 http://www.bci‐info.ch/ 402",

Unintentionally produced HCB wastes from solvent production Wastes from the production of chlorinated solvents at the former Kalush Chemical and Metallurgical Industrial Complex were buried near Kalush City, Ukraine. The solvents produced included carbon tetrachloride, tetrachloroethene and dichloroethene (ethylene dichloride EDC) for PVC manufacturing. Solvent production started in 1973 with an estimated production capacity of approximately 30,000 tons per year. Approximately 540 tons of hazardous “HCB waste” with unintentionally produced HCB as a primary contaminant was produced annually, suggesting an emission factor of 18 kg “HCB waste”/t solvent produced for this factory (Weber et al. 2011). The total amount of “HCB waste” deposited was estimated to be approximately 11,000 tons (UNEP, OCHA and EU Commission 2010). Since the HCB content of the waste is around 20%, the total amount of HCB deposited at this site can be estimated to be around 2,200 tons (Jacoff et al. 1986). Sampling of “HCB waste” also found PeCB at levels approximately an order of magnitude lower than HCB. The total quantity of PeCB waste contained in the total 11,000 tons of “HCB waste”",

The total quantity of PeCB waste contained in the total 11,000 tons of “HCB waste” can be estimated to be approximately 200 tons. Other cases of stored or deposited HCB waste show that the inventories for solvent production facilities which did not have adequate destruction capacity in the 1950s to 1990s are of the same order of magnitude: • The manufacture of chlorinated solvents by Orica between 1963 and 1991 produced more than 10,000 tons of concentrated “HCB waste” (Independent Review Panel 2006) (www.oricabotanytransformation.com). About 1,000 tons of this waste was generated by the production of ethylene dichloride (EDC) for manufacturing PVC. • 80,000 drums of “HCB waste” were disposed of from Spolchemie (Chabaiovice,Czech Republic) near the Elbe river (Heinisch et al. 2006). Subsequent leaching of the waste into the Elbe river resulted in high concentrations of HCB accumulating in downstream sediments and PeCB levels of approximately 15% of those of HCB (Heinisch et al. 2006).

The active gamma‐isomer was commonly separated, and the remaining 85 to 90% waste isomers, consisting mainly of alpha‐HCH and some beta, delta and epsilon‐HCH, were dumped. A global inventory of these wastes was compiled based on information collected for over 20 years of production, including HCH production capacities and estimated amounts of wastes generated (Vijgen et al. 2011). 1.6 – 1.9 million tons of disposed HCH waste were thus estimated in the former producing countries (Albania, Austria, Argentina, Brazil, China, Croatia, Czech Republic, France, Germany (including former German Democratic Republic), Hungary, India, Italy, Japan, Macedonia (former Yugoslavia), Nigeria, Poland, Romania, Slovakia, South Africa, Spain, Switzerland, Turkey, The Netherlands, UK, USA, and the former USSR). This inventory is considered to underestimate the scale of the problem because of the incomplete reporting and the likely existence of unidentified productions sites and waste deposits. In a second inventory approach, the total quantity of HCH waste was estimated by using the proportion of waste isomers produced per tonne of lindane used (Vijgen et al. 2011). Global historical lindane use for agricultural purposes was estimated to have been between 1950 and 2000 of 450,000 t, with the largest share (63%) in Europe (Vijgen et al. 2011). Additional use of lindane on livestock, in forestry, in human pharmaceuticals and for other purposes has also been considered and is estimated to add another 150,000 t (Vijgen 2006a,b), bringing the total global figure to 600,000 t. According to Bodenstein (1972), the total HCH isomer waste was about 8 tons per ton of Lindane produced. Other experts have estimated about 10 tons per ton of Lindane produced (Krum 1982) and 10‐12 tons per ton of Lindane produced (Treger 2004). Using the range of these approximations (8 to 12 tons",

Using the range of these approximations (8 to 12 tons), the total global amount of HCH waste is estimated between 4.8 and 7.2 million tons, constituting the largest international POPs stockpile. 10c Application Sites of PCDD/PCDF Containing Pesticides and Chemicals The total amount of PCDD/PCDF releases from former pesticide use and related contaminated areas has been investigated and assessed in Japan (Masunaga 2001, Seike et al. 2007, Weber and Masunaga 2005). Two herbicides, PCP and CNP, applied from 1950s to 1980s, contained elevated concentrations of PCDD/PCDF. In the case of CNP, the average PCDD/PCDF content in formulations produced pre‐1982 was estimated to be 6 g/kg and 3.60 mg TEQ/kg active ingredient (N= 39 samples). After 1982 the PCDD/PCDF content of CNP decreased to 0.71 g/kg and 0.022 mg WHO‐TEQ/kg active ingredient (N= 23 samples) (Masunaga et al. 2001, Seike et al. 2003). High PCDD/PCDF levels were found in PCP produced in the early 1960s, but also for some PCP produced at the end of the 1970s. The average dioxin content in PCP (N= 14 samples) was 3.3 g PCDD/PCDF per kilogram and 1.5 mg TEQ/kg active ingredient (Masunaga et al. 2001, Seike et al. 2003). Other pesticide formulations contained comparatively low concentrations of PCDD/PCDF (Masunaga et al. 2001). The total dioxin releases from the application of pesticides on rice fields and agricultural areas in Japan during 1955‐1995 was estimated based on the arithmetic average concentration of PCDD/PCDF in historical pesticides and the amount of pesticides used. The total emission from PCP use was estimated to be 540",

The PCDD/PCDF pattern in human milk samples from Japan has even nowadays a significant input from former PCP use (Tawara et al. 2006, Weber et al. 2008). A historical PCDD/PCDF inventory application and PCDD/PCDF transport to rivers and ocean sediments has been established for the Tokyo Bay basin (Masunaga 2004, Weber and Masunaga 2005). For this task, the dioxin load of the Tokyo Bay basin was estimated from the annual quantities of agrochemical shipments to Tokyo, Saitama, Chiba and Kanagawa prefectures, the percentage area belonging to the basin, and the dioxin contamination of the agrochemicals. The PCDD/PCDF load of the Tokyo Bay basin due to PCP use was estimated to be approximately 31,000 kg PCDD/PCDFs and 14 kg TEQ. The contribution from CNP was estimated to be 9,300 kg PCDD/PCDF and 5 kg TEQ. The total amount of PCDD/PCDFs deposited in sediments was estimated from sediment core data (Masunaga 2004). A comparison between the total PCDD/PCDF emissions and the sediment load in Tokyo Bay shows that only a few percentages of PCDD/PCDF applied to paddy fields as agrochemical impurities have been deposited in the Tokyo Bay. Due to the persistency of these compounds, the remaining PCDD/PCDF still exist in terrestrial soil and river sediments, representing an input source into the future. According to the concentration of PCDD/PCDF in Tokyo Bay sediments, the flux from PCP use remained constant over the past 20 years. This indicates that PCDD/PCDF transport processes in the environment may last for decades and most likely centuries. 45000 40000 35000 30000 25000 20000 15000 10000 5000 0 1955 1960 1965 1970 1975 1980 1985 1990 1995 2000 2005 Year )raey/Q",

      "text": "Toolkit for Identification and Quantification of Releases of Dioxins, Furans and Other Unintentional POPs January 2013 The first inventory of PCB‐containing equipment in Belarus was developed in 2004. More than 2,000 enterprises were covered in the inventory process. The methodology is described in Kukharchyk and Kakareka (2008). About 40 companies were identified as owners of PCB‐containing transformers and 750 companies as owners of PCB‐containing capacitors (Government of Belarus 2006). All of these sites were treated as potential hotspots. A database was created, containing detailed information on the facilities and the PCB‐containing equipment, including facility name and address, types and number of equipment, trademarks, volumes of PCB, dates of manufacture, condition of the equipment, levels of operation, descriptions of installations or storage locations. The total volume of PCB in PCB‐containing equipment in Belarus was estimated at 1,500 tons. 55% of the total amount of PCB is contained in power transformers and 44% in power capacitors. A substantial part of PCB‐containing equipment has been removed from service long time ago: around 25% of capacitors and 9% of transformers with a total volume of 230 tons PCB have been taken out of operation. In the past, no measures have been taken to ensure storing of PCB‐containing equipment in an environmentally sound manner. The condition of power capacitors and transformers was evaluated in many cases as unsatisfactory, due to the destruction of their frames. The sites where PCB leakages occur were also revealed. Special attention was given to open sites where the probability of PCB leakage was very high. Documented accidents were also taken into account. Special field investigations of selected sites were organized with the aim to indicate damage characteristics, features of PCB leakages, etc. Based on the results of the investigation, PCB release factors were developed: for PCB‐containing transformers – 0.3 kg/t dielectric fluid, for capacitors – 2 kg/t (EMEP/EEA 2009). It was found that approximately 1.5 tons of PCB are annually discharged into the environment from leaking power transformers and capacitors. The potential discharges of PCDD/PCDF were calculated taking into account the total PCB leakage from PCB‐containing equipment and the content of PCDD/PCDF in low chlorinated dielectrics fluids (in capacitors) and high chlorinated fluids (in",

The PCB database is updated every year, including information on the total number of PCB‐containing equipment and equipment taken out of service (Government of Belarus 2006). Several projects investigating PCB‐contaminated sites and soil pollution were implemented during 2005‐ 2011 in Belarus, including on‐site inspection, identification of damaged equipment, detection of leakages, soil sampling and analysis. More than 80 open sites and several dozens of closed sites where PCB‐containing equipment is still in operation or in storage were investigated. As a result, the list of PCB contaminated sites was developed including facility name, address, location, type of sources, and PCB content in soil. About 60 sites were found to have polluted soil. PCB content in soil is found at levels up to milligrams or sometime grams per kilogram (Kukharchyk et al. 2008, 2011). The highest concentrations of PCB (up to 105 g/kg) were found in the soil near destroyed capacitors and transformers. In most cases, PCB content in soils was heterogeneous; usually there are several small hotspots within one site. The size of hotspots is different; most of them are less than 1 m2, but sometimes reach up to 50 m2. The largest polluted site has an area of more than 1000 m2 and included several individual hotspots. Generally, the number of hotspots and their size depends on the area where 406",

The highest level of pollution was found in the upper soils (top 10 cm). However, in some cases, high levels of PCB pollution were also found at depths of 1 m and more. 2) PCB‐containing paint/varnish production A significant source of PCB release into the environment was the use for paint and varnish production (Kukharchyk et al. 2008). Historical data on the annual volume of PCB in use at the Lakokraska factory in the city of Lida, Belarus were collected. It was established that during 1968‐1998, about 5,000 tons of Sovol was used. The paint/varnish production process was analysed and possible ways of Sovol discharges into environment were assessed. Taking into account technological discharges of raw material, it was established that approximately 130 tons of Sovol were released into the environment (mainly in soil) on the site of the plant. PCB content in soil was found at levels up to 96.6 mg/kg. The spatial distribution of PCB is homogenous in comparison with the places where PCB‐containing equipment is installed or stored. Penta‐ and hexachlorobiphenyls are dominating among PCB compounds, with 53% and 28% respectively, clearly indicating that the source of PCB discharge is Sovol. II. Inventory of PCB contaminated sites impacting rivers and fish The Swiss Federal Office for Environment in cooperation with the Swiss EMPA developed a methodology for inventorying PCB‐impacted water bodies and classification according to the dioxin‐like PCB content in fish. The inventory approach includes tracking of PCB point sources resulting in levels of dioxin‐like PCB in fish above the regulation limits for fish consumption. Monitoring data of 1,300 fish samples analysed over two decades were evaluated. For three rivers, dioxin‐like toxicity levels above legislation limits were found (BAFU 2010). An inventory of impacted river sections was then established (Zennegg et al. 2010). Fish were contaminated within sections of 20 to 40 km of river. In a second step, river sections with",

In a second step, river sections with elevated PCB levels in fish were screened for point sources by passive sampling. A former disposal site (La Pila) was identified as the point source responsible for PCB contamination in the Saane river. The landfill was used for domestic and industrial waste (from 1952 to 1975). The amount of PCB was estimated to be more than 20 tons within approximately 195,000 m3 waste (Zennegg 2010). Flooding events and rain washed out these PCB and enabled their migration into the river. On the basis of PCB levels measured in fish, water bodies were classified into three categories (Zennegg 2010): the first category was defined as water bodies with PCB background contamination corresponding to levels below 4 pg WHO‐TEQ/g fw (50% of the maximum level of 8 pg WHO‐TEQ/g fw); the second category contains water bodies with diffuse to higher PCB load and levels of 4 to 8 pg WHO‐ TEQ/g fw in fish; the third category was defined as water bodies with high PCB contamination, where most fish species exceed the permitted maximum level. 407",

The application of such sludges on land or through their dumping have resulted in hotspots or contaminated land. Paper sludge residues from a German paper mill were deposited on an area of 7,000 m2 during the 1970's (Rotard et al. 1990). The area was developed into a residential area in the 1980s. For the assessment, the area was divided into 12 sectors of about 500 to 1,000 square meters each. From each sector, 20 to 35 soil samples were taken from a depth of 0.3 m, then mixed thoroughly to give a representative sector sample. Some samples were taken at a depth of 4 meters by ram core sampling. The area was found interspersed with paper sludge lumps on the surface and at depths of 1.8 meters. Soil samples showed contamination of up to 149 ng/kg I‐TEQ. The sludge lumps contained PCDD/PCDF levels between 573 to 5,165 ng/kg I‐TEQ (Rotard et al. 1990). 10h Waste Incinerators If incinerators are operated according to BAT and the wastes managed according to BEP, PCDD/PCDF contaminated sites or hotspots should not be generated except for the deposit of fly ash and air pollution control residues which can still have relatively high levels of contamination. Experience has shown that incinerators which are not well‐operated and controlled can produce high levels of PCDD/PCDF emissions to all media and result in contaminated sites or hotspots. Emissions from a chemical waste incinerator at the Coalite Chemicals plant in Bolsover (UK), which was used for the incineration of chlorinated phenol wastes, resulted in elevated PCDD/PCDF levels in cow’s milk from the surrounding area (Holmes et al. 1994, 1998) and other foodstuff including game birds (Malisch et al. 1999).

This case demonstrates that hazardous waste incinerators that process high proportions of products from the organochlorine industry, especially PCDD/PCDF precursors (PCB, chlorophenols, chlorobenzenes and other chlorinated aromatics), can result in high emissions of PCDD/PCDFs with considerable impacts on the local environment (Holmes et al. 1994, 1998). The Coalite plant also generated high levels of contamination in river sediments. Investigations by the UK National Rivers Authority found that the river sediments contained 20,269,000 ng/kg PCDD/PCDF (45,300 ng/kg TEQ) immediately downstream of the company's outfall, while the upstream levels were of only 2,030 ng/kg (9 ng/kg TEQ). The impact of the site was discernable 11 kilometres downstream on the Rother river, where sediments contained 110,000 ng/kg PCDD/PCDF (ENDS 1994). Further, the largest release vector for PCDD/PCDF from BAT/BEP incinerators are residues and ashes from flue gas treatment, which can contaminate the environment if they are not appropriately managed. One example is the Byker municipal waste incinerator in Newcastle (UK) where ashes (generally a mixture of fly and bottom ash) were used to construct footpaths and added to the garden soils, resulting in elevated PCDD/PCDF levels in food (eggs and vegetables) (Pless‐Mulloli et al. 2001, Watson 2001). 10i Recycling of e­waste 408",

Such low‐tech e‐waste recycling sites exist predominantly in developing and transition countries and PCDD/PCDF emissions from the open burning of PVC and partly flame retarded and PCB‐containing e‐waste can be very high. A wide range of PCDD/PCDF and other dioxin‐like compounds including brominated and mixed halogenated dioxins, furans, biphenyls and other mixed brominated‐chlorinated aromatics have been detected at open burning sites in Guiju, China (Yu et al. 2008, Zennegg et al. 2009, Leung et al. 2007, Li et al. 2007, Wong et al. 2007). Preliminary inventory investigations of PCDD/PCDF and dioxin‐like compounds revealed contamination levels of soils above international limit values (Yu et al. 2008). A combination of instrumental‐ and bioassay‐based assessments was used for adequately estimating dioxin‐like toxicity. Levels up to 100 µg TEQ/kg soil have been measured at open burning sites (Yu et al. 2008), with brominated‐chlorinated PXDD/PXDF as a main contributor (Zennegg et al. 2009). In the Guiyu area, where e‐waste burning has been practiced for more then a decade, the contamination levels in the soils are in the kg TEQ range. These sites are also highly contaminated with heavy metals resulting in ground water pollution (Chan et al. 2007). All these aspects need to be considered when developing pollutant inventories for these sites. 10j Accidental Fires On December 22, 1992, a fire destroyed a warehouse containing cable drums at JSC \"Irkutskcable\" (Shelekhov, Irkutsk region). The fire destroyed an area of 20,000 m2 around the ignition point, including adjacent warehouses containing plastic resin and paper, as well as a drying and impregnation shop.

According to draft assessments, 600 tons of PVC plastics and 100 tons of PVC film were destroyed in the fire (Kiselev and Khudolej 1997). For technical reasons, fire masks were not used. Acute poisoning has been confirmed for 69 firefighters; 43 of them were recognized as disabled. As a result of incomplete combustion, PCDD/PCDF were released. The soot formed during the decomposition of PVC cables contained up to 200 ng PCDD/PCDF per gram. It should be noted, however, that the uncertainty of the results is high due to the limited volume of samples analyzed. 10k Dredging of Sediments and Contaminated Flood Plains The Elbe river has been impacted during almost a century by POPs (PCDD/PCDF, HCHs, DDT etc.) and other pollutants such as Organo‐tin from industrial discharges, including organochlorine production and other industries using chlorine in the Bitterfeld region of Germany. The sediments and floodplains were shown to be contaminated with PCDD/PCDF approximately 350 km downstream ‐ as far as Hamburg and even the North Sea (Götz et al. 2007). The sources of pollution have been assessed and an inventory developed, showing that approximately 60 km2 of lowland area downstream of the Spittelwasser creek are heavily contaminated by PCDD/PCDF, HCH and DDT. The pollutant reservoir includes 20,000 m3 of highly contaminated PCDD/PCDF sediments (Förstner and Salomonis 2010). PCDD/PCDF levels in the floodplains soils reached up to 2,100 ng I‐TEQ/kg. In addition to inventory activities, the options for the different zones along the river (river shore, inner dyke, outer dyke) have been assessed taking into account the EU food limits for managing cattle and feedstuff in the floodplains (Schulz et al. 2005, Kamphues et al. 2011).

Major components included shredder residues from end‐of‐life vehicles and electric appliances, paper mill sludges, slags, dewatered industrial sludge, incineration residues. A detailed assessment and inventory of the wastes, surrounding soil, groundwater and surface water was conducted. It revealed that wastes and soil were contaminated with notable quantities of heavy metals and chlorinated organic compounds, including an estimated 1.5 kg TEQ PCDD/PCDF (Takeda 2007). Water soluble pollutants contaminated groundwater with a risk of releases to the sea and shore. A remediation plan was established to excavate the waste and the contaminated soil and transport this material to a neighbouring island where an incinerator and a melting plant was built (Takeda 2007). The cost of the remediation work was estimated at 428 million US$, while the operation of the dumpsite had generated approximately 3 million US$ revenue (Takeda 2007). Love Canal (United States) The example at the Love Canal site in the Niagara County also shows successful site remediation and cleanup procedure.35 The site encompasses a hazardous waste landfill where chemical waste products were disposed of from 1942 to 1952 by an Electrochemical Company. It first came into national prominence in the late 1970s, when it was discovered that contaminated leachate had migrated to the surface of the canal and to nearby residential basements. Contaminants also migrated to nearby creeks via the sewage system. Scientific studies did not conclusively prove that",

Contaminants also migrated to nearby creeks via the sewage system. Scientific studies did not conclusively prove that these chemicals were responsible for residents' illnesses, and scientists were divided on the issue, even though eleven known or suspected carcinogens had been identified, one of the most prevalent being benzene. Polychlorinated dibenzodioxins were also found, with levels measured in water samples of 53 ppb. In October 1978, containment measures were undertaken, including the construction of a tile drain and leachate collection system, placement of a clay cap over 16 acres of the canal, creation of an on‐site leachate treatment facility and installation of a fence around the area. Approximately 1,000 families have been relocated from the area. In 1984, 40 acres were covered by a synthetic liner and clay cap and surrounded by a barrier drainage system. A long‐term monitoring study was implemented to evaluate the effectiveness of the leachate collection system and assess the contaminant migration in soil and groundwater. In September 2004, the EPA removed the Love Canal site from the National Priorities List (NPL). All cleanup work had been 35 http://www.epa.gov/history/topics/lovecanal/index.html 410",

The site will continue to be monitored and remains eligible for cleanup work in the event that a change in site conditions should warrant such an action. The discovery of toxic waste dumps such as the Love Canal led to the adoption of the Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA) in the United States. CERCLA is commonly referred to as the \"Superfund\" because of the fund established to help the cleanup in residential locations (http://www.epa.gov/superfund/). The Superfund cleanup process involves steps to assess sites, placing them on the National Priorities List (NPL), and establish and implement appropriate cleanup plans. Over the past years, tens of thousands of hazardous waste sites and other polluted sites were located and analyzed. Currently, 13,742 sites are listed, among which 1,723 sites belong to the NPL. The inventory contains 225 sites polluted by PCDD/PCDF, among which 210 NPL sites, and 488 sites polluted by PCB, including 431 NPL sites. 10m Kaolin or Ball Clay Sites Several kaolin and ball clay deposits have been found to be contaminated with PCDD/PCDF in different regions in the word (Hori et al. 2011). The Dutch governmental institute RIKILT analysed 28 samples of “pregnancy clays” (20 from Africa and 8 bought in The Netherlands) for the presence of PCDD/PCDF as part of a first inventory of contaminated clays in some African countries (Uganda, Kenya, Tanzania, Nigeria, Mali, Ivory Coast and Zimbabwe). In some regions, such as Africa and South America, clay minerals and soils are consumed by pregnant women as a cure for morning sickness and possibly a source of minerals such as iron. Clay for this use is available for sale in many parts of the world. Consumption can be as high as 300 gram per day, but average daily intake seems to be around 30‐80 gram (Hoogenboom et al. 2011). The study assessed whether the clays were contaminated and carried a potential risk for the newborns. Four of these samples showed relatively high levels of PCDD/PCDF: 66 ng TEQ/kg product (Mabele, Cameroon),",

The study assessed whether the clays were contaminated and carried a potential risk for the newborns. Four of these samples showed relatively high levels of PCDD/PCDF: 66 ng TEQ/kg product (Mabele, Cameroon), 66 ng TEQ/kg product (Mabele, Democratic Republic of Congo), 75 ng TEQ/kg product (Kaolin, Côte d’Ivoire) and 103 ng TEQ/kg product (Mabele, country of origin unknown). In addition, a sample from Nigeria (Nzu) had a level of 24 ng TEQ/kg product and a sample from Cameroon (Mabele) had a level of 4.5 ng TEQ/kg product. Levels in other samples were much lower (Hoogenboom et al. 2011). Only PCDDs contributed to these TEQ levels, but the congener patterns were not the same for all clay samples. The WHO/UNEP coordinated study on human milk included a number of African countries. The clay data have been compared with human milk data to evaluate whether the consumption of clay may add to the dioxin exposure. The highest PCDD/PCDF levels in African samples where observed in Côte d’Ivoire (11.1 pg TEQ/g fat) and the Democratic Republic of Congo (11.1 pg TEQ/g fat) whilst the other samples were in the range of 1.5 to 3.9 pg TEQ/g fat (Malisch et al. 2011). The PCDD/PCDF pattern of the clay and human milk samples, along with the relatively high levels measured in Congo and the Ivory Coast suggest that the use of clay during pregnancy contributes to these high PCDD/PCDF levels in human milk. Due to vulnerability to PCDD/PCDF in the fetal development phase and for the newborn, the use of contaminated clays should be prevented. Inventories of clays used for human consumption or as animal feed additive should be carried out as a matter of urgency. 411",
