This document provides guidance on how airlines and users of aviation services should set targets aligned with a well-below 2°C ambition (the goal of the Paris agreement). Target setting approach for airlines ● The target setting method for airlines is based on the SBTi’s Sectoral Decarbonization Approach (SDA) which states that a company’s carbon intensity should converge to the sector’s Paris-aligned GHG intensity by 2050 Decarbonization pathway for the aviation sector ● The rate and scale of aviation decarbonization is defined by the International Energy Agency’s (IEA) Energy Technology Perspectives (ETP) 2020 report which models GHG reduction requirements for each sector based on a number of assumptions including forecasted sector growth, availability of mitigation levers and socio-economic factors ● To align with the Paris agreement, the aviation sector is required to reduce average carbon intensity by ~35-40% between 2019-2035, or ~65% from 2019-2050 Scope of emissions covered ● The impact of aviation non-CO₂ factors on warming is acknowledged but not included in quantitative target setting due to scientific uncertainty and lack of mitigation solutions ● To raise awareness of non-CO₂ impacts of aviation, airlines are encouraged to participate in data sharing, collaboration and include non-CO₂ factors in other climate commitments Process to set a target ● Companies may use the accompanying SBT aviation Excel tool to help set SBTs",

Neutralization: To reach a state in which human activity no longer contributes to global warming means achieving a state in which anthropogenic GHG emissions no longer accumulate in the atmosphere. For companies, this means neutralizing the impact of any source of residual emissions that is unfeasible to eliminate by permanently removing an equivalent volume of atmospheric CO . 2",

      "text": "Partner organizations CONTEXT What are science-based targets (SBTs) SBTs specify how much and how quickly a company needs to decarbonize to align with the Paris Agreement goals Science-based targets specify how much and how quickly a company would need to reduce its greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in order to align with the goals of the Paris Agreement - to limit warming to well-below 2°C above pre-industrial levels (WB-2°C) and pursue efforts to further limit warming to 1.5°C. This report builds on existing Science Based Targets initiative guidance, in particular the SBTi Transport Target Setting Guidance (2018), and the GHG Protocol Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard to outline how much and how quickly the aviation industry needs to decarbonize to meet the goals of the Paris Agreement. It shows the conclusions of a group of experts and industry stakeholders2 that have been focused on developing best practices for science-based target setting in aviation since March 2020. This science-based target setting methodology for aviation has been built on the SBTi’s Sectoral Decarbonization Approach (SDA) which allows aviation industry stakeholders including passenger and cargo airlines, contracted freight forwarders and business travelers to set GHG intensity targets that are aligned with a WB-2°C scenario (the temperature goal outlined in the Paris agreement). The aviation sector in context Aviation is considered a heavy-emitting sector, but the sector needs to act now to respond to increasing regulatory, investor and consumer pressures Because of its relatively higher abatement costs than the rest of the economy, aviation is considered to be a hard to abate sector, representing ~2.4% of global CO₂ emissions in 2018. Efforts to decarbonize air travel face significant headwinds due to large technical barriers 2 The aviation pathway development process has been supported by analysis from the International Council on Clean Transportation, a Technical Working Group involving >15 representatives from airlines, freight carriers, research organizations and industry bodies",

      "text": "Partner organizations associated with removing or replacing jet fuel, challenging industry fundamentals, such as low profit margins (2-4% global average) and limited historic regulatory pressure to decarbonize. The recent COVID-19 pandemic has impacted aviation at a fundamental level, causing industry wide disruption and, at the pandemic's peak, a greater than 90% reduction in monthly Revenue Passenger Kilometers (RPKs) in April 2020. As the world begins to return to normal, flight activity in the aviation sector will see a return of demand – however, the rate of increase over the coming years is highly uncertain. Prior to the COVID-19 crisis, the industry was already seeing a changing investor and consumer sentiment towards flying, both due to an increasing corporate focus on emissions targets, as well as consumer-driven movements such as “flying shame”. However, it is possible that these changing attitudes will only have been exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. Indeed, many businesses have become increasingly accustomed to a remote working model. Whether sustainably-minded travelers take to the skies again will depend partially on a cost- benefit analysis: weighing up the benefits of travel against the costs in both financial and carbon terms. Therefore, now more than ever, it is imperative for airlines to decarbonize: sustainability and sector recovery should go hand in hand. Setting science-based targets represents a credible signal to consumers, investors and regulators that the industry is ready, willing and able to take action and re-build with climate at the top of the agenda. For aviation companies, the business case is clear: not only does setting a science-based target demonstrate to customers and investors a willingness to act, but decarbonizing now is key to creating future resilience and competitive advantage in a low carbon economy. Overview of the public consultation process A public consultation was organized from November 20 to December 11 2020 to get input from industry and civil society stakeholders on this guidance document and accompanying target setting tool. Feedback from over 60 stakeholders was received through an online survey and over two consultation webinars were held in December 2020.",

      "text": "Partner organizations DEVELOPMENT OF AVIATION DECARBONIZATION TRAJECTORIES Overview of the Sectoral Decarbonization Approach (SDA) A target setting method based on intensity metrics which incorporates industry growth forecasts into decarbonization targets The SDA is a target setting methodology developed by the SBTi allowing companies to set science-based greenhouse gas intensity targets aligned with a well-below 2°C scenario. Essentially, the SDA attempts to address a fundamental tension in corporate target setting: that rapid decarbonization is incongruent with industry growth. For commercial aviation, this uncertainty could be framed as: “How much would the aviation sector’s average carbon intensity need to decrease in order to achieve Paris aligned decarbonization goals whilst also allowing for projected industry growth?” The SDA answers this question by helping companies model physical intensity GHG reduction targets that align with the sector-specific pathway of an underlying climate scenario. The rate of decarbonization needed to meet the Paris goals is defined by scientific findings from Integrated Assessment Models (IAMs). These models detail how a global carbon budget should be spent over time and divided by sector based on a number of factors, including: sector mitigation potential, socio-economic drivers, regional factors and technological availability. One of the outputs of IAMs is an annual emissions pathway - an illustration of the necessary emissions each sector can emit in every future year in order to be consistent with a specific temperature outcome. In the SDA, annual emissions pathways are divided by forecasted industry activity to define a carbon intensity curve. These curves can help compare the carbon intensity of an individual company and the sector overall. For example, if a company has a higher carbon intensity than the sector average it is considered to have less carbon-efficient operations than its sector peers. The SDA builds upon the comparison between sector-wide and company intensities. Targets are set by assuming that all companies converge to the same intensity level as the sector by the year 2050. Science-based targets are set in the short to medium term (5 to 15 years) along this convergence path, the steepness of which is defined by the relative intensity of the company compared to the sector in the base year and the rate of forecasted company activity growth. The larger the relative difference, and the faster the growth, the more stringent the intensity target for an individual company.",

The International Energy Agencies (IEA) flagship Energy Technology Perspectives (ETP) model has been used as the source of annual emissions pathways for all previous SBTi SDA tools. The latest ETP publication describes two scenarios. ● The Stated Policies Scenario (STEPS) which outlines the current emissions trajectory (2020-2070) for each sector based on existing and planned policy commitments ● The Sustainable Development Scenario (SDS) which outlines an emissions trajectory (2020-2070) for each sector consistent with limiting warming to 1.8°C above pre- industrial levels at a 66% probability - this is considered to align to the Paris ambition of limiting warming to well-below 2°C For development of this SBTi aviation sector intensity pathway, the IEA ETP SDS was considered a credible, transparent data source for the annual emissions pathway. The SBTi uses the SDS model as an input to the intensity equation, defining how much and how fast the sector needs to decarbonize. The scenario developed by IEA is based on a number of underlying assumptions detailed in Figure 2. This scenario (and accompanying assumptions) represent just one illustrative way to achieve the required decarbonization aligned to a well-below 2°C scenario - the SBTi does not prescribe a specific technological roadmap and acknowledges that individual companies may achieve the required targets via a different combination of levers than what is outlined in the SDS.

      "text": "Partner organizations IMPORTANT NOTICE: A 1.5°C pathway is currently under development and will be integrated into this SBTi Aviation Guidance and accompanying target setting tool. The Science-Based Target Aviation Guidance and Tool has been developed by the World Wildlife Fund for Nature (WWF) on behalf of the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi), with support from the International Council for Clean Transportation (ICCT) and Boston Consulting Group (BCG), to help companies in the aviation sector model science-based emission reduction targets, based on the Sectoral Decarbonization Approach (SDA). According to the ICCT, during 2019 passenger aircraft were responsible for 85% of commercial aviation CO2, and it has been estimated that CO2 emissions from commercial aircraft are on pace to triple by 2050. Due to the urgency for the aviation sector to start taking actions to prevent the worst effects of climate change, as well as to respond to increasing regulatory, investor and consumer pressures, through this Guidance, companies with air transport emissions will be encouraged to set science-based targets to limit warming to well-below 2°C above pre-industrial levels, which is the primary objective of the Paris Agreement. The SBTi recognizes the importance of a corporate ambition aligned to the higher 1.5°C ambition level, that is why a pathway aligned with a 1.5°C scenario is currently under development using the sector specific emissions and activity projections in IEA Net Zero 2050 Roadmap publication, which will facilitate well- below 2°C target submission throughout the transition period defined by the SBTi, before the 1.5°C ambition update comes into effect on July 15th 2022. In the interim, it is recommended that aviation stakeholders seeking a higher ambition target utilize the Absolute Contraction methodology to set a 1.5°C target or set a complementary long-term Net Zero target when specific guidance for Net Zero targets is published by SBTi in 2021. Sector activity forecast The IEA ETP Sustainable Development Scenario (SDS) is used to derive long-term industry activity forecasts To derive a sector-wide GHG intensity pathway, activity forecasts that reflect expected industry growth are required. As a general rule, the faster the sector is expected to grow, the faster its GHG intensity must decrease to meet the annual emissions pathway consistent with the relevant temperature scenario.

      "text": "Partner organizations Approach to sectoral segmentation The airline industry provides a variety of services using different aircrafts. To set fair and reasonable targets, the SDS total emissions budget for commercial aviation is divided into five segments based on payload type and stage length. This sectoral segmentation process followed two general principles: (1) materiality (that there should be a material difference in intensity profile between segments) and (2) compatibility (that segmentation should not incentivize avoidable business models that result in higher-intensity operations). Based upon these criteria, emissions pathways for five market segments were developed (Figure 3). Research shows that the CO₂ intensity of short-haul flights (<1,500 km) is significantly higher than that of longer flights, pointing to the need for segmentation by stage length. Likewise, there are inherent differences in the business models of passengers and dedicated freight carriers that necessitate a separate emissions pathway. On average, belly freight demonstrates similar CO₂ intensity to long-haul dedicated freight using recommended industry practices for emissions allocation (see Figure 3). However, considering the different business models and operational arrangements for these two services, belly freight is designated as a separate segment for target setting. Figure 3: Aviation sector segmental split used in pathway development Total emissions and activity in 2019 were segmented using ICCT’s Global Carbon Assessment Model (GACA). GACA estimates flight fuel burn for each unique origin-destination-airline- aircraft combination using OAG historical flight operations data. Emissions and activity estimated by GACA are validated using airline and government data from major markets, including Europe, the US, China, and Japan, and matches well with high level statistics published by the International Air Transport Association (IATA).",

      "text": "Partner organizations IEA’s SDS assumes a constant split between passenger and freight emissions over time; 91% of total commercial aviation CO₂ is attributed to passenger aircraft, while the remaining 9% is emitted from dedicated freighters.3 Emissions associated with belly freight transport are included in the passenger emissions budget. Regarding traffic, the SDS assumes a 2.9% annual growth rate for both passenger and freight traffic between 2020 and 2050. To develop each segment’s emissions pathway, the share of emissions by payload type (e.g. passenger vs. freight), stage length (short vs. medium/long haul), and freight type (belly vs. dedicated) was held constant at 2019 levels as estimated by GACA. Similar to total emissions, the share of revenue passengers and freight revenue tonnes transported by stage length was held constant at 2019 levels. An emissions allocation factor was used to apportion emissions between passengers and belly freight on common flights. The mass of 100 kg of passenger plus 50 kg for seats and furnishings (e.g., lavatories, service trolley, etc.) was assumed, as recommended by IATA. Using this 100 kg + 50 kg approach aligns the intensity profile of belly freight to that of dedicated freight, avoiding potential market distortions and rewarding belly freight carriage on passenger flights. Note that this allocation was only used in development of the emissions pathway - alternative allocations may be used by airlines setting targets (most relevant to segmenting the business of a freight forwarder that contracts for both dedicated and belly cargo). Figure 4: Emissions allocation during pathway development used a 100+50kg factor for belly cargo in alignment with IATA best practices.

      "text": "Partner organizations Pathway boundaries and assumptions Due to the inherent complexity in climate target setting and the specific nuances of the aviation sector it is necessary to define explicit boundaries and scope for emissions covered by the aviation pathway and for target setting. Emissions boundaries for the aviation pathway Jet fuel is the primary pollutant from aviation, representing >90% of most airlines’ value chain emissions.4 For that reason, this SBTi pathway focuses exclusively on jet fuel emissions. For target setting methodologies covering non jet fuel -related emissions (e.g. airport ground operations, office buildings, etc), please refer to other SBTi guidance. Jet fuel use results in GHG emissions across the aviation value chain, from production, refinement and distribution of the fuel to ultimately fuel combustion in a jet engine. These value chain emissions can be split into two components: emissions from combustion of fuel, referred to as Tank-to-Wake (TTW), and emissions from production, refinement and distribution, known as Well-to-Tank (WTT). Combined, the full value chain emissions from jet fuel are referred to as Well-to-Wake (WTW) i.e. the summation of tank-to-wake and well-to-tank emissions. It is typical for many stakeholders to only consider direct combustion (TTW) when measuring emissions; however, the aviation pathway development process builds off the precedent set from previous SBTi transport guidance to develop pathways on a WTW basis. There are two key rationales for development of an aviation pathway on a WTW basis. 1. Inclusion of the upstream production and distribution (WTT) component is required to credibly account for use of Sustainable Aviation Fuels (see section 4.2). 2. Inclusion of upstream production and distribution (WTT) will best capture emission reductions from future alternative power plants, including those that consume electricity and hydrogen, please see SBT Transport Guidance for greater details on this precedent. Boundaries for target setting The boundary for GHG inventories and targets should be as comprehensive and accurate as possible. Emissions not covered by a target cannot be responsibly managed or reduced. The first step in setting a target involves measuring and accounting for GHG emissions. Best practice accounting follows guidance from the Greenhouse Gas Protocol (GHGP) which structures emissions from Kyoto gases according to three scopes: scope 1 representing direct 4 Based on the average of 19 airline CDP disclosures (2018)\n\n2.

      "text": "Partner organizations emissions from operations (for jet fuel this is TTW emissions), scope 2 representing electricity consumed from operations (limited relevance for aviation) and scope 3 representing all emissions from the upstream and downstream supply chain (for jet fuel this is WTT emissions). Emissions within the scopes should be accounted for in terms of CO₂e, where the “e” represents the equivalent CO₂ warming impact of other Kyoto gases.5 From a target setting perspective, to align with the pathway boundary, and to recognize that an airlines choice of fuel can influence both the upstream and combustion emissions, this guidance and tool requires users to account for the full value chain impact of jet fuel within their target setting boundary i.e., scope 1 + scope 3 category 3 (Well-to-Wake, WTW). Furthermore, in cases where Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) is utilized, direct and indirect land use change impacts (LUC / iLUC) should additionally be considered in the target boundary - see section 4.2 for further guidance on SAF accounting. Addressing non-CO₂ effects of aviation Aviation SBTs only cover Kyoto GHGs - recommended best practice for non-CO₂ factors includes transparent accounting, data sharing and inclusion in other climate commitments Whilst CO₂ remains the most commonly cited and arguably best-understood pollutant from aviation, its contribution to global effective radiative forcing (ERF) i.e., warming, is estimated to be only a fraction (~⅓) of the industry's total impact. Emerging research validates long-held beliefs that other pollutants from jet engines can cause further warming beyond the impact of carbon alone. For example, particulate matter has been linked with increased contrail-induced cirrus cloudiness and NO emissions with net increased x GHG formation.6 Despite the clear importance of these “non-CO₂ factors” on aviation-induced warming, the science underpinning these findings remains nascent. Furthermore, mitigation levers targeting these factors also remain untested, limiting the ability for individual companies to both measure the impacts and then take directed action. As a result, the SBTi pathway developed in this process only covers CO₂ emissions and other Kyoto GHG’s (methane, nitrous oxide, hydrofluorocarbons, perfluorocarbons & sulphur 5 Note, this does not include the impact of non-CO₂ factors, see section 2.5.3 6 Increased NO emissions show to result in a net warming factor from a combination of increased O x",

Nonetheless, the SBTi recognizes that aviation non-CO₂ induced ERF will likely need to be addressed to deliver the ultimate goal of limiting warming to well-below 2°C. To that end, this guidance introduces an additional target-setting criterion related to disclosure of emissions boundaries covered by targets, as well as recommendations for best practices for addressing the impact of non-CO₂ factors. Sector-specific target setting criteria Aviation target formulation and communication must explicitly state that targets are exclusive of non-CO₂ factors. Aviation target formulation must include a footnote stating that non-CO₂ factors which may also contribute to aviation-induced warming are not included in this target and whether the company has publicly reported or commits to publicly report its non-CO 2 impacts. Sector-specific recommendations The SBTi also recommends best practices related to consideration of non-CO₂ factors ● Data sharing and collaboration to stimulate research and development, including sharing of flight and technical data, will be key to better understanding and ultimately developing mitigation approaches for limiting the impact of non-CO₂ ERF. ● Incorporation of non-CO₂ ERF into additional targets, e.g., airlines are encouraged to include the full impact of non-CO₂ ERF in other target setting processes e.g., Net Zero commitments. Sector carbon intensity pathways Based on the underlying emissions pathway and activity forecasts from the IEA ETP 2020 SDS, sectoral segmentation and the defined pathway boundaries, a sector average carbon intensity pathway consistent with a well-below 2°C scenario can be derived. The average pathway along with segmented variants represent the required rates of decarbonization for the sector as a whole and are used to define the target intensity to which each company must converge by 2050.",

Whilst the fundamentals of the Sectoral Decarbonization Approach remain consistent regardless of user, specific guidance and adjustments have been developed for different aviation stakeholders interested in setting targets. These variations predominantly address differences in accounting practices, operations and scope of emissions. Operators of aircraft include airlines that carry either passengers, belly cargo, dedicated cargo or a combination. Science-based targets for operators of aircraft may be derived using the SBTi Aviation tool. The target-tool for airlines interface is split into 5 key sections: 1. Settings: Users should input a base year and a target year. The SBTi recommends choosing the most recent year for which data are available as the target base year.7 For the choice of target year, targets must cover a minimum of 5 years and a maximum of 15 years from the date the target is submitted to the SBTi for validation. 2. Base year emissions data: Base year emissions in tonnes of CO e8 for total passenger 2 or dedicated cargo operations. a. Emissions data should be submitted on a Well-to-Wake basis - the sum of both scope 1 emissions from jet fuel combustion and scope 3 category 3 “fuel- and energy-related activities” emissions from upstream production and distribution of jet fuel. b. If Well-to-Wake data is not available, users may enter Tank-to-Wake data (scope 1). In this instance, default Well-to-Tank emission factors will be applied to convert TTW emissions values into WTW values. c. Optionally, airlines may indicate the percentage of emissions which originated from flights <1,500km in stage length.

      "text": "Partner organizations MECHANISMS TO REALIZE TARGETS The SBTi helps companies understand how much and how quickly they need to reduce emissions within their value chain in order to be consistent with the goals of the Paris Agreement. To that end, the SBTi’s primary focus is on target setting, rather than prescribing the technological roadmap required to meet the targets. Nonetheless, this guidance outlines some common aviation decarbonization levers and discusses any SBTi-specific considerations where relevant. Improving efficiency of technology and operations11 Jet fuel use has a major impact on airline profitability, typically representing about one-quarter of direct operating costs. Improving fuel efficiency remains an important way for airlines to reduce emissions, particularly until low carbon fuels can be scaled up and become cost competitive with fossil jet fuel. Airlines have three main levers to improve fuel efficiency: (1) replacing older aircraft with newer, more fuel-efficient designs; (2) improving operations to carry more payload (passengers and freight) per flight and to fly more directly to destinations; and (3) finding optimal flight paths and avoiding congestion near airports. Each new generation of aircraft burns 15% to 20% less fuel per passenger-kilometer than the aircraft it replaces. Key technologies include more fuel-efficient engines, improved aerodynamics, lightweight materials such as advanced composites, plus advanced systems (e.g., all-electric aircraft) and integrated design. Historically, new aircraft fuel burn has fallen by 1.3% per year since the 1960s due to new technologies. In addition to buying new aircraft, airlines can improve fuel efficiency by increasing flight payloads and flying more directly to destinations. Payload can be increased by better filling a given capacity (e.g., flying with fewer empty seats) or by expanding capacity (e.g., swapping out premium seating in favor of economy seats). Reducing “circuity” by avoiding unnecessary layovers and routing flights more directly can also reduce fuel burn. Operational improvements typically reduce the fuel intensity of airlines by an additional 0.5% per year. The final, smallest component is to improve air traffic management to reduce air delay and near-airport congestion through technologies like GPS-based navigation. In 2008, the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) estimated that systemwide fuel efficiency could be improved by 12% through improved air traffic management. Subsequent analysis has found 11 Based on ICCT research",

Collectively, airlines typically reduce their GHG intensity by 1.5 to 2.0% per annum over the mid to long term via these strategies. Accelerated action, likely supported by government regulation and incentives, can support about 2.5% per annum reductions over the long-term. Faster reductions -- as high as 8% over one year -- have been seen for smaller airlines pursuing aggressive fleet renewal strategies. Using Sustainable Aviation Fuels Sustainable Aviation Fuels (SAF) are considered to be a critical lever for decarbonizing aviation. As liquid fuels chemically similar to kerosene, they can be used interchangeably in aircraft engines when blended with up to 50% with fossil jet fuel – indeed, >200K flights have already flown on a biofuel blend between 2008-2019. There are four “generations” of SAF: (1) biofuels made from harvested crops; (2) biofuels made from non-food crops or waste feedstocks, such as used cooking oil or agricultural residue; (3) algae and (4) synthetic fuels (PtL) made from renewable electricity, water and captured CO₂. Depending on the feedstock and technology pathway used, SAF has the potential to significantly reduce lifecycle GHG emissions - combustion of the fuel still releases carbon, but the feedstock itself may capture or sequester carbon, artificially or through biomass. Airlines may choose to procure SAF in order to lower their Well-to-Wake CO₂e emissions and hence improve overall carbon intensity. Consumers of aviation services may also rely on SAF to achieve science-based targets (as explained in sections below). To this end, the SBTi has developed guidance for use of SAF specific to aviation science-based target setting. Accounting for SAF use SAF accounting follows the precedent for bioenergy use outlined in the SBTi Criteria and Recommendations document as well as the GHG Protocol guidance12. “C4 — Bioenergy accounting: Direct CO₂ emissions from the combustion of biofuels and/or biomass feedstocks, as well as sequestered carbon associated with such types of bioenergy feedstock13 , must be included alongside the company’s inventory and must be included in the target boundary when setting a science-based target and when reporting progress against that 12 See also Smart Freight Centre and MIT Center for Transportation & Logistics’ Sustainable Aviation Fuel Greenhouse Gas Emission",

The global energy and land system will likely require both rapid decarbonization (50% by 2030) and the use of carbon sequestration solutions in order to achieve a state where there is not net accumulation (or indeed net reduction) of CO₂ in the atmosphere. Whilst both reductions in emissions and removals of GHGs are required immediately and in parallel, science-based reduction targets focus exclusively on the former - defining how much and how quickly a company needs to reduce emissions within its value chain. The role of corporate use of CO₂ removals is considered in SBTi Net Zero guidance; however, it is not part of this pathway, which focuses on emission reductions only. We understand how fast the global system needs to decarbonize, but the question of how much and how quickly a company must reduce in its value chain is more complex. To answer this, the SBTi uses data from Integrated Assessment Models (IAMs) such as the IEA ETP. The ETP maps the global energy system, across all sectors and geographies, illustrating scenarios of decarbonization consistent with the goals of the Paris Agreement and based on a range of input assumptions, e.g., a global carbon price and availability of mitigation levers. These assumptions are weighted together to determine the rate and volume of decarbonization required in each sector. The output of the ETP represents an optimized decarbonization scenario, wherein each economic sector has been allocated a “fair share” of the decarbonization burden. Because this model already allocates reductions across sectors (to a degree based on economic efficiency), it is required that each sector’s “fair share” of GHG reductions occur within the industry value chain. The concept of in-value chain reductions is a core premise of science-based reduction targets and is a logical conclusion from the scientific underpinnings of the methodologies. As a result, the use of carbon credits that either reduce carbon emissions outside of the value chain or remove carbon from the atmosphere cannot be considered equivalent to in-value chain reductions, and hence are not suitable levers to meet science-based reduction targets. Whilst science-based reduction targets must be achieved without the use of credits, recent guidance on science-based Net Zero targets outlines the prospective role for neutralization credits (tradeable GHG removals) and compensation credits (tradeable GHG reductions or avoided",

As per SBTi guidance, organizations with more than 40% of their total footprint in scope 3 are required to set SBTs that cover at least two-thirds of their scope 3 emissions. For companies that have significant emissions arising from aviation services, the target setting tool and guidance below provide specific considerations for target setting related to scope 3 categories 4, 6 and 9. Understanding the scope 3 baseline for target setting In accordance with SBTi criterion C18, companies should set targets that collectively cover at least ⅔ of total scope 3 emissions. This target setting guidance and methodology is suitable for use against a subset of targets within scope 3 category 4 and scope 3 category 6. Within these categories, only emissions relating to aviation emissions from operation of aircraft may be included. A specific consideration for this sector relates to the treatment of non-CO factors. As discussed 2 in section 2.5.3, inclusion of non-CO factors in the target setting boundary is not currently 2 considered credible given the high degree of scientific uncertainty and lack of available mitigation levers. Similarly, non-CO factors should therefore not be included in a company's 2 scope 3 inventory when calculating a company’s SBTi scope 3 target boundary. Scope 3 categories 4 and 9 target setting method Companies can follow the steps outlined in Section 3 and apply the air freight pathway available in the SBT aviation tool to model targets covering emissions from air transport activities from contracted freight (belly and dedicated freight), i.e., scope 3 category 4 “upstream transportation and distribution” and/ or scope 3 category 9 “downstream transportation and distribution”.

Due to the differentiated growth rates of a given firm’s business travel relative to the rest of the aviation sector,14 as well as logical inconsistencies in the target setting method,15 the Sectoral Decarbonization Approach (based on the principle of intensity convergence) is not considered appropriate for business travel target setting. As an alternative to use of the Sectoral Decarbonization Approach, multiple options were considered, including other intensity convergence models, intensity contraction and sectoral absolute contraction. After analysis16 of these options, Absolute Contraction was considered the most credible and robust approach for business travel target setting. This approach builds upon the Absolute Contraction methodology as outlined in the SBTi paper, Foundations of Science-based Target Setting. Absolute Contraction targets may be modelled through a dedicated interface in the SBT aviation tool. The interface requires scope 3 category 6 target setters to disclose absolute emissions from business-related air travel in a defined base year (the most recent year with a complete GHG inventory17) and select a target year 5-15 years from the current date. A scope 3 category 6 aviation target will be calculated based on the minimum annual linear reduction rate for Scope 3 targets, defined by the SBTi (1.23%). While Absolute Contraction targets are calculated based on an absolute emissions footprint, the SBTi recommends that scope 3 category 6 aviation business travel targets are communicated as an intensity metric: gCO₂e/full- time employee (FTE). The use of standardized intensity metric is a sector-specific criterion of scope 3 category 6 aviation business travel targets which allows for efficient comparison and interpretation of targets across firms. Target formulations must indicate the emissions covered, the base year and target year selected, the percentage reduction and the units. As per the sector-specific criterion for scope 3 category 6 emissions, targets should be expressed on an intensity basis in terms of gCO₂e/FTE. 14 Aviation sector growth rates used in the SDS include both leisure and corporate travel demand 15 The SDA methodology assumes a closed market system whereby each actor represents a mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive share of the total market.

Use of SAF by consumers of aviation services could follow a “Book-and-Claim” approach if consistent with the Greenhouse Gas Protocol accounting framework.

Hence, until standardized guidance on SAF accounting is available and endorsed by GHGP, corporate use of SAF to meet SBTi scope 3 targets should: ● Obtain reasonable proof of fuel consumption / combustion ● Demonstrate environmental benefits associated with the SAF used (e.g., Certificate of Sustainability (CoS)19, including SAF lifecycle values) ● Prove clear chain of custody for the SAF consumption down, rather than across, the value chain (i.e., a business traveler could only purchase SAF from an upstream supplier, either an airline or a fuel producer20) ● Include full accounting of Well-to-Wake emissions from all fuel consumption (SAF + fossil fuel) in a firm's scope 3 inventory The impact of SAF consumption should be calculated by using the fuel-based method outlined in the GHGP scope 3 category 6 guidance, alongside ICAO guidance on lifecycle emissions factors for feedstock types as outlined in guidance in section 4.2.2.

Future recognition of such frameworks may be considered in updates to this guidance. 19 Certification of Sustainability as defined by IATA 20 This guidance does not aim to address all potential mechanisms for SAF procurement - due to a lack of recognized accounting infrastructure at the time of writing, SAF procurement via other mechanisms cannot be assessed. 21 The distance-based method combined with the fuel-based approach risks double claiming the environmental benefits of SAF in a situation where distance-based emissions factors incorporate reductions realized from SAF use.

      "text": "Partner organizations GLOSSARY Carbon dioxide emission budget (or carbon budget) For a given temperature rise limit (for example, a 2°C long-term limit), the corresponding carbon budget reflects the total amount of carbon emissions that can be emitted for temperatures to stay below that limit. Stated differently, a carbon budget is the area under a carbon dioxide (CO₂) emission trajectory that satisfies assumptions about limits on cumulative emissions estimated to avoid a certain level of global mean surface temperature rise. Carbon dioxide equivalent (CO₂e): A way to place emissions of various radiative forcing agents on a common footing by accounting for their effect on climate. It describes, for a given mixture and amount of greenhouse gases, the amount of CO₂ that would have the same global warming ability, when measured over a specified time period. Sectoral Decarbonization Approach (SDA): The SDA is differentiated from other existing science-based target methods by virtue of its subsector-level approach and global least-cost mitigation perspective, in line with the carbon budget related to a given temperature goal. Currently, the SDA tool uses the sector decarbonization trajectories of the International Energy Agency (IEA). Convergence approach used in the Sectoral Decarbonization Approach (SDA): The convergence approach for homogeneous sectors in the SDA is based on the assumption that the GHG intensity of a company converges towards the GHG intensity of the sector at a rate that ensures not exceeding the sectoral carbon budget. The rate of convergence of a company is a function of the initial GHG intensity of the company, the GHG intensity of the sector and the growth of the company relative to the growth of the sector. Tank-to-Wake emissions (TTW): Tank-to-Wake emissions cover all the energy used once transformed, i.e., emissions occurring during the combustion of the fuels by vehicles.",

      "text": "Partner organizations Well-to-Tank emissions (WTT): Well-to-Tank emissions are based on attributional life-cycle assessment studies of fossil- derived fuels (e.g., gasoline, diesel, compressed and liquefied natural gas), biofuels and electricity (based on time- and scenario-specific estimated average grid GHG intensity). Energy use and emissions resulting from pipeline transport are accounted for under “Energy industry own use” in the International Energy Agency’s own modeling. Well-to-Wake emissions (WTW): Together, TTW and WTT make up WTW GHG emissions. This does not include emissions from vehicle or battery manufacturing or those offset by material recycling, among others. Revenue Passenger Kilometer (RPK): An RPK is the unit of measurement representing the transport of one paid passenger by air over one kilometer. Revenue Tonne Kilometer (RTK): An RTK is a unit of measure of freight transport which represents the transport of one tonne of goods (including packaging and tare weights of intermodal transport units) by air over a distance of one kilometer. Scope 1 emissions for transport: Emissions derived from the combustion of fossil fuels in a vehicle; generally derived from invoices (e.g. tons of fuel purchased). Scope 2 emissions for transport: Emissions derived from the combustion of fossil fuels to produce electricity that is consumed in a vehicle. Scope 3 Category 3 “Fuel and energy related activities”: This category includes emissions related to the production of fuels and energy purchased and consumed by the reporting company in the reporting year that are not included in scope 1 or scope 2. This category includes emissions from four distinct activities: (1) upstream emissions from purchased fuels (extraction, production and transportation of fuels consumed by the",
