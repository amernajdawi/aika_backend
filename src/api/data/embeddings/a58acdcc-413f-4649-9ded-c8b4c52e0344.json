      "text": "Executive summary Information on the quantities of pollutants released – emissions – is important for understanding whether control measures are successful. The European Green Deal established the Zero Pollution Ambition (EC, 2019) which relies on baseline information by which to determine whether pollution is being reduced. Unfortunately, despite decades of effort within countries, we still lack good information on the total emissions of pollutants released to water across Europe. The Water Framework Directive (WFD) (EC, 2000) requires Member States to report an inventory of emissions, discharges and losses of priority substances. Technical guidance on preparing the emissions inventory has been published (EC, 2012), but experience from the electronic reporting of the second River Basin Management Plans showed that Member States needed further information to help them report in a more consistent and comparable way. This report is aimed at those preparing inventories of emissions to water. It provides a simplified method for calculating the emissions to water and is intended to help where there is currently limited emissions information available, as well as providing a benchmark for those already with some knowledge. It describes quantification methods for the 13 pathways for emissions to surface waters referred to in the WFD Technical Guidance (EC, 2012), with factsheets giving an overview of each pathway and detailing specific calculation methods. Efforts have been made to gather as much information on priority substance concentrations and emission factors, relevant to European countries, as possible. Each factsheet starts with an introduction describing the pathway and the substances most relevant to that pathway. Calculation methods to quantify the emissions from that pathway are then explained, followed by conclusions. Detailed annexes contain data about emission factors and calculated emissions per country. The proposed methods can contribute to the harmonisation of the methods used for the quantification of emissions to water, and in that way improve the comparability of reported emission data between countries. However, the proposed emission factors are often averages based on data from different countries and may differ from actual emissions, depending on specific local or regional situations. This is why the work is offered as support in cases where no better local information is available. Note also that the advice provided in this report is not required to be applied by countries.

      "text": "1 Introduction 1.1 Background Information on the quantities of pollutants released – emissions – is important for understanding whether control measures are successful. The European Green Deal established the Zero Pollution Ambition (EC, 2019) which relies on baseline information by which to determine whether pollution is being reduced. Releases reducing significantly over time would indicate that controls are taking effect, while no change or increases should demand further attention. Unfortunately, despite decades of effort within countries, we still lack good information on the total emissions of pollutants released to water across Europe. Emissions can be assessed in different ways and since many rely on calculation and estimation, attempts to produce estimates comparable at European level have been confounded. Several projects showed serious problems regarding the consistency, completeness (1) and quality of the reported emission data, both in Europe and beyond (Roovaart et al., 2013; Roovaart et al., 2016; ETC/ICM, 2017; EEA, 2018a, 2018b; OECD 2017; Damania et al., 2019). The issues identified in the projects mentioned are wide-ranging and require action from a number of different groups, including reporters, regulators, facility managers and legislators. The issues are summarised here as: • poor information on diffuse sources, owing to gaps in reporting, • incomplete reporting of urban wastewater treatment plant (UWWTP) effluents – not all UWWTPs, not all relevant pollutants, • incomplete reporting of industrial sources – not all facilities, not all relevant pollutants, • inconsistent reporting in time and space – few comparable and consistent time ranges and not all river basin districts reported, • long time frames for updating of reporting obligations – which delays information-gathering on newly- recognised pollutants. As a consequence of these issues there is: • no EU wide overview of relevant emission sources/pollutants, • no consistent time series of data from which to calculate trends, • limited insight into the effects of emission reduction measures, • no clear relation between emissions and water quality, • no insight which measures are needed to meet the water quality targets. 1.2 Aim of this report The aim of this report is to support those reporting the emissions inventory under the WFD, WISE-1 emissions (2) and other data collections.

      "text": "2 Simplified method for the quantification of emissions to surface water 2.1 Sources and pathways of emissions A general scheme in which the main principal sources, pathways and intermediates of emissions to water are represented was developed under the WFD Common Implementation Strategy (EC, 2012) (Figure 2.1). On the lefthand side of this scheme, the principal sources of pollutants are shown, representing groups of sources which can be related to economic sectors or activities. The natural background is also represented as a separate source. In fact, this is a rather complicated source because natural background concentrations can also be a part of the other pathways and double counting must be avoided. Emissions, discharges or loads can follow different pathways, either directly to surface water, or to other compartments of the environment (air, soil, groundwater). A specific place is given to urban areas with the impermeable surfaces, the sewer system and the wastewater treatment plants, both urban (UWWTPs) and industrial (IWWTPs). While different approaches are shown in the scheme (riverine load approach, source-oriented approach and pathway-oriented approach), the quantification of the different pathways (P1–P13) is the core of a complete emission inventory. Most of the existing emission reporting requirements can be related to one or more of these defined pathways. Several countries use the riverine approach instead of the pathway approach for the quantification of emissions. The riverine approach can help to assure the quality of the pathway approach but lacks insight into the different sources behind the pathways and leads to less accurate calculations. This makes it difficult to make a connection to possible mitigation measures. This proposal will therefore focus on the quantification of the pathways P1–P13. The factsheets in this report give an overview of each pathway and elaborate on the specific calculation methods. Each factsheet has the same structure. It starts with an introduction in which the pathway and the most relevant substances for that pathway are described. In the next paragraph the calculation methods to quantify the emissions from the specific pathway are explained. Finally, conclusions are drawn. Detailed data about emission factors and calculated emissions per country are added as Annexes. Literature references for all the pathways are combined into one reference list. To provide more insight into which mitigation measures are possible to reduce the emissions, it helps to have information on the primary sources (e.g. use of products, processes) within households and small and medium enterprises (SME’s) (3), which end up in sewers and",

This method has been described by Mohaupt et al. (2001) and has been applied for seven metals in the Rhine catchment. The estimated loads agreed rather well with the loads of the river Rhine, as measured at the Dutch-German border. This method has been applied in various emission inventories in the Rhine catchment including nutrients and Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs) (Besozzi et al., 2003; ICBR, 2016; ICBR, 2021). This emission factor method was also used in the EC project: ‘Diffuse water emissions in E-PRTR’ (Roovaart et al., 2013). In this project, diffuse emissions to water have been quantified for a selection of 40 key sources and key substance combinations, covering the EU Member States and the European Free Trade Association (EFTA) countries (Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland) on a River Basin District sub- unit scale (Roovaart et al., 2013). Emission factors are often used in emission inventories, both for air and water (Pulles and Heslinga, 2007). For the simplified quantification of emissions in this report, the emissions of a pollutant for an activity are calculated by multiplying an activity rate (AR ) for a specific a activity (or pathway) by an emission factor for this activity and a certain pollutant (EF ), expressed in p,a emission per AR unit.

The calculation method is shown in the formula below: E = AR x EF p,a a p,a Where: E = Emission of a pollutant for an activity p,a AR = Activity Rate for an activity a EF = Emission factor of a pollutant for an activity p,a The emissions calculated in this way are referred to as the total emissions for that substance. For an activity where all the emissions are released directly into surface waters e.g. P12 (Inland Navigation), the total emission is the same as the net emission to surface waters. However, more commonly only part of the calculated emissions end up in surface waters, so an extra factor needs to be introduced to account for the other part, e.g. in soil, to describe the percentage of the emissions actually reaching surface waters. Not all the pathways can be covered with the simplified emission factor method. Some pathways are too complex to be described with only an AR and an EF. For those pathways (e.g. P1 (Atmospheric deposition directly to surface water) and P3 (Surface runoff from unsealed areas)) models were used, e.g. MONERIS (4), MoRE (Fuchs et al., 2017), and Pegase (Deliège et al., 2009). Different models may use different definitions of pathways, combine pathways or split up pathways into relevant sub pathways, but all these models make use of emission factors. To refine or complement the reported emission factors, the Danube Hazard m3c project provides a database on concentrations of hazardous substances and pathways of emissions to surface waters (5). The results (“Inventory of Concentrations on Hazardous Substances”) will be available by the end of 2022. This research project also highlights the benefits of a transnational assessment (on a European level), showing that joint measurements can be comprehensive and effective. Especially in areas, where higher pollution loads are more likely to occur and when the monitoring procedure is standardized (6,7,8,9). 2.2.1 Activity Rates (AR) This report proposes the use of AR’s, to make use of freely available statistical data which are updated on a regular basis, e.g. the Eurostat Database (10).

This approach facilitates the regular updating of the emission inventory and limits the overall burden of emission reporting. Examples of an activity rate are: population size; population equivalent (p.e.); the distance driven by cars (km). The chosen AR should be relevant for the specific activity or process (e.g. the number of people connected to an Urban Waste Water Treatment Plant (UWWTP). In the following chapters more specific references are listed. In some cases, appropriate data for the ideal AR are not available or the available data sets might contain gaps for specific areas or time periods. In such cases a “proxy variable” can help to derive at least a rough estimate of the AR. Such a proxy variable could be the population size or Gross Domestic Product or other high-level indicators of the size and the economic activities in a country. When using a proxy, one has to assume or derive a relationship between the value of the data searched for and the value of the proxy in countries or years where data are available. The estimates for the gaps then follow from the application of this relationship (Pullis and Heslinga, 2007).

      "text": "2.2.2 Emission Factors (EF) Emission factors are related to a specific AR and pathway and are pollutant specific. An EF may vary in time and space, mainly as a result of the implementations of new technologies and mitigation measures (like banning or limiting specific products or uses) and differences in national or regional use of products or the appliance of processes. One of the big challenges for a simple emission inventory is to find an optimum between using general EF’s where possible, but with the ability to differentiate, if necessary. A simple example is given for the quantification of emissions from UWWTPs (pathway 8, see Chapter 7) for lead: E = AR x EF where: E(Emission) = emission of lead by UWWTPs in a RBD (kg/year) AR (Activity Rate) = annual (mean) effluent flow for all UWWTPs in a RBD (m³/year) EF (Emission Factor) = concentration of lead in effluent (µg/l). With an EF for lead of 0.73 µg/L (see Table 7.4) and a hypothetical AR of 106 m³/year, we can calculate an emission of lead to surface water of 0.73 * 10-9 (µg to kg) * 106 * 103 (m3 to l) = 0.73 kg/year. 2.2.3 Spatial scale The easiest way of using the simplified emission factor method is to apply it at country level, as a lot of statistical data are available on a countrywide scale. Emission sources are in general not evenly distributed. Specific emission sources or pathways can occur much more in one place or in a specific region of a country. For countries who are in the early stages of developing emission inventories, or developing into new areas, more detailed calculations to the level of River Basin Districts (RBD) may be made once capacity and expertise improve. For the WFD, an emission inventory on the level of RBD will be more useful than on a country level and can be seen as “an ultimate goal”. Where data are presented on a country level in this report and its annexes, the intention is to cover the full list of EIONET members and cooperating countries (38 countries).

Previous work had investigated the 15 pollutants most frequently reported as causing failure to achieve good chemical status under the WFD (Table 2.1) (EEA, 2018b). Despite many years of the monitoring of point sources, there were still rather few Member States reporting diffuse sources of metals, with even fewer reporting emissions of other pollutants. Monitoring data, providing concentrations of substances for particular pathways or sources, were found from literature searches and studies, particularly for the pathways P6 (Surface run-off from sealed areas), P7 (Stormwater outlets/combined sewer overflows/unconnected sewers), P8 (Urban waste water treated) and P9 (Individual – treated and untreated – household discharges). Data are most commonly found for metals and PAHs. It was possible to provide data only for a limited number of pesticides in the pathways P2–P5. As the focus of this activity was on WFD priority substances, not nutrients, future work could include gathering information on total nitrogen and total phosphorus. In the calculations, both the dissolved substances and substances in the sediment phase are included. No distinction has been made between these two in the calculations.

      "text": "3 Atmospheric deposition directly to surface water (P1) 3.1 Introduction Atmospheric deposition of substances on water and soil can be described as “the load to surface water or soil via the atmosphere”. Once emissions from sources (e.g. traffic, shipping, industries) have entered the atmosphere, the substances are distributed through the atmosphere and end up in the surface water and in the soil as a result of deposition in wet (precipitation) and dry form. Emissions to water from atmospheric deposition result from direct emissions to surface water and indirect emissions due to emissions from the sewer system (e.g. collecting run-off water from paved areas), overflows from combined sewer systems and effluents from wastewater treatment plants. For this factsheet, the calculated emissions are only the direct loads to surface water. The loads to the sewer system and the sewer overflows are not considered in this factsheet but are included in the pathways P7 and P8. The loads to unsealed areas and the resulting loads from soil to surface water are included in the pathways P2–P5. This factsheet sets out a method for calculating the atmospheric load to surface water (not to soil) for metals (Cd, Hg and Pb), PAH, HCB, PCDD/F and PCB153. Significant amounts of metals are emitted to the atmosphere from anthropogenic sources, natural sources and volcanism. Currently the main anthropogenic emission sources in the EMEP region (11) are combustion and industrial processes. In addition to the anthropogenic sources, a considerable amount of particle- bound metals (e.g. Pb, Cd) enters the atmosphere through wind re-suspension of dust, containing metals. Metals released to the atmosphere are partly of natural origin and partly come from (previously) accumulated anthropogenic deposition (MSC-E, 2022). Most of the persistent organic pollutants (POPs) are emitted into the environment by anthropogenic emission sources. Anthropogenic emissions of POPs can be divided into industrial emissions and legacy contribution from past agricultural uses. PAH can also be expected from natural sources like, for example, forest fires and volcanic activities. In addition, PAHs are formed unintentionally during combustion. They are present in fossil fuels and enter the environment during incomplete combustion in, for example, coke ovens and motor vehicles as well as through cigarette smoke and small-scale wood burning. For the emissions per country or River Basin District (RBD), the model studies of EMEP can be used. EMEP (Co-operative programme",

      "text": "3.2 Calculation methods EMEP distinguishes two types of modelling: 1. Modelling of ecosystem dependent deposition including land cover. The deposition flux on water bodies and wetlands is calculated in kg/km2/year for cadmium, lead, and mercury (see chapter 3.2.1). Land cover data in EMEP developed by the MODIS (Strahler et al, 1999) is used in the model, for water bodies and wetlands the following definition is used: • wetlands: Lands with a permanent mixture of water and herbaceous or woody vegetation. The vegetation can be present in either salt, brackish, or fresh water; • water bodies: Oceans, seas, lakes, reservoirs, and rivers. Can be either fresh or salt-water bodies. 2. Modelling of the total deposition flux expressed in g/km2/year for the other substances (see chapter 3.2.2 and 3.2.3). The EMEP modelling results are based on the EMEP 0.1º x 0.1º longitude-latitude grid. Shapefiles (12) per country are available. 3.2.1 Ecosystem dependent deposition (metals) For cadmium, lead and mercury, the modelled deposition flux is available per type of land use in g/km2/year, the ‘Ecosystem dependent deposition’. Water bodies and wetlands are part of these various types of land use. For each EMEP grid, a flux for waterbodies and a flux for wetlands is available (13) in the Ecosystem-specific information datasets. The area (km2) of the grids differs per country. At the border with other countries or the ocean, the grid will be smaller. To calculate the atmospheric deposition loads, the fraction of water bodies and wetland per EMEP grid must also be known. This information (GIS shapefile) is not reported on the EMEP website but can be requested from EMEP by e-mail. Calculation: 1. Deposition on surface water per EMEP-grid: Deposition to water = Flux to water * Area_km2 * Water Fraction Deposition to wetland = Flux to wetland* Area_km2 * Wetland Fraction 2.

The EMEP website shows also maps and data per country for the deposition from and to a country for the year 2018 (15). For these substances no distinction has been made per landcover by EMEP. To calculate the deposition per country to surface water, the percentage of surface water per total country area should be known. For that purpose, the surface water fraction per grid cell can be calculated from the file with the water and wetland fractions requested from EMEP (see chapter 3.2.1). Calculation: • Deposition on surface water by the total flux per EMEP-grid: Total deposition = Total flux * Area_km2 * (Water + Wetland fraction) • Deposition on surface water per MS = sum of deposition on surface water of all EMEP-grids The flux and area per EMEP-grid is reported in the EMEP downloads. The percentage of surface water per country can be calculated with the water and wetland fraction per EMEP grid. 3.2.3 PAH (16 EPA) compared to Benzo(a)Pyrene Because EMEP models only benzo(a)pyrene (BaP), the ratio of the other PAHs to BaP is determined using the deposition measurements in precipitation which are available on the EMEP website (16). For all monitoring stations, the average per year is calculated for 2015–2019 (Aas, 2020). For each monitoring station, this average per PAH is divided by the average of BaP for the specific year. Then, the median, 10 and 90 percentile and the number of the deposition measurements are determined for all monitoring stations. Table 3.1 shows the ratio for the 16 EPA PAH fluxes compared to the BaP flux in precipitation.

      "text": "4 Erosion (P2), surface runoff from unsealed areas (P3), interflow/tile drainage/ groundwater (P4), direct discharges and drifting (P5) 4.1 Introduction This fact sheet describes the pathways P2, P3, P4 and P5. There are multiple, diffuse, anthropogenic emissions to surface water, among which agricultural practices play a major role. Metals and pesticides from agricultural land will reach the surface water by one or more of these pathways and their loads are related. Depending on the soil management and type of crop, a certain percentage of agricultural inputs will then leach, run-off, erode or reach surface waters in some other way. The different pathways are described in this introduction. In the calculations, both the dissolved substances and substances in the sediment phase are included. No distinction has been made between these two in the calculations. The focus here is on agricultural sources with a large contribution to the loads to surface water. Note that not all existing primary sources are covered in this chapter: other sources, less significant at European level, such as surface runoff from more natural areas, are not included. It may be appropriate for countries with large sectors such as forestry to gather more specific emissions data on those activities. 4.1.1 Erosion (P2) Erosion describes the transport process of land surface materials, especially rocks, sediments, and soils by the action of water, wind, or a glacier. The displacement of the upper soil layer is mainly caused by the runoff through heavy rainfall events or by strong winds. Although erosion is a natural process, it was greatly accelerated by human activities over the past decades. For instance, intensive agriculture and deforestation can foster erosion processes, due to long periods where soils are left without vegetation cover that serves as a protection against weathering. Furthermore, anthropogenic climate change enhances erosive processes caused by increasing numbers of heavy rainfall events and longer dry periods, as plant cover can be destroyed and leave the soil surface unprotected. In general, surface runoff is the dominant erosive process in the EU. Soil erosion may be a slow process that continues relatively unnoticed, or it may occur rapidly, causing a serious loss of topsoil. Erosion causes both \"on-site\" and \"off-site\" problems. The eroded material is transported downhill and deposited again or transported to surface waters, where it may cause siltation with negative effects for ecosystems and stream hydraulics. On-site, erosion leads to soil loss and soil",

The eroded material is transported downhill and deposited again or transported to surface waters, where it may cause siltation with negative effects for ecosystems and stream hydraulics. On-site, erosion leads to soil loss and soil degradation at the hillside, e.g. decline in organic matter and nutrient content, the breakdown of soil structure, and a reduction of the available soil water holding capacity. Off-site erosion describes the transport of eroded material downhill and its deposition or further transport into surface waters. Eroded soil material from agricultural fields may contain a number of pollutants, which are absorbed into soil particles, like clay (e.g., phosphate, metals, some pesticides). 4.1.2 Surface runoff from Unsealed Areas (P3) Runoff occurs when there is more water than can infiltrate the land surface or be held up by the land (Figure 4.1). The excess liquid flows across the surface of the land and into nearby creeks, streams, or ponds. The most familiar types of natural runoff are caused by rain or melted snow water. But runoff may originate from irrigation, too. Runoff from agricultural fields may contain several pollutants, e.g. nutrients (phosphate, nitrate), pesticides, pathogenic bacteria and veterinary antibiotics (from animal manure), as well as metals (from inorganic fertilizers or natural background concentrations in the soil itself). Depending on pollutant properties, different portions of the output from fields may be transported either in the dissolved or the sediment phase of runoff water.

      "text": "4.1.3 Interflow, Tile Drainage and Groundwater (P4) This pathway covers the transport of substances after leaching into the soil, whereas pathway P3 describes the runoff at the soil cover. We distinguish three types of leaching: • Interflow The interflow is a relatively rapid subsurface flow toward the stream channel that occurs near to the surface of the soil. Interflow typically flows more slowly than surface runoff. But it occurs more rapidly than baseflow, which does not result from direct runoff, but is the portion of stream discharge derived from groundwater (Figure 4.1). • Tile drainage An artificial drainage system removes excess water from soil below its surface. All parts except the outlet are located below the surface of the ground. It provides better drainage because it removes water from the soil to the depth of the drain. • Groundwater As water moves down towards the groundwater, it leaches pollutants from the soil particles, dissolving them and carrying into the groundwater. Figure 4.1: Schematic overview of surface runoff, interflow and baseflow in a catchment 4.1.4 Direct Discharges and Drifting (P5) Pathway 5 covers the direct discharges and drifting of pollutants which can reach surface waters. Here, it is mainly understood to concern pesticides, fertilisers and manure. • Direct discharges: When fertilisers, manure or pesticides are handled on farms, a part of it may cause unintended pollution of ditches/streams via spillages on hard surfaces or direct input from application machinery (e.g. overspray). • Drifting: Drift or spray drift can occur during the application of fertilizers or Plant Protection Products (PPP) in the field. It is the airborne movement of fertilizers or pesticides from a treated area to any unintended site. Drift can happen during application, when droplets are transported away from the target site, or after the application, when some chemicals become vapours that can move off-site. This so called 'vapour drift,' and an important factor for the quantification of vapour drift can be calculated with the pesticide's vapour pressure. Spray drift can be important under specific conditions and also affects soil and surface water. Examples are where one field is sprayed with herbicides and the drift affects the growth of a crop in a neighbouring field. Spray drift is more important for pesticides, than fertilizers. In section 4.3 (calculation methods – pesticides) we only consider spray drift directly reaching surface water.",

      "text": "4.1.5 Modelling the pathways P2 – P5 Without detailed models, it is not possible to distinguish between pathways P2 to P5. Therefore, we have chosen to discuss these pathways together in this factsheet. Estimation is made of the land-based sources and then these are combined with an (average) loss to surface water. This factsheet distinguishes between metals and pesticides. Regarding the metals it is restricted to the WFD priority substance (17) metals cadmium (Cd), lead (Pb) and nickel (Ni). They will be described in 4.2. The pesticides are described in 4.3. It deals with three WFD priority substances: aclonifen, bifenox and cypermethrin (18), and a number of pesticides identified as River Basin Specific Pollutants (RBSPs). 4.2 Calculation methods – metals Concerning metals, this factsheet describes the two pathways of soil erosion and leaching to surface waters, and the calculation of the resulting loads of metal emissions to surface waters through these pathways. Data availability on pollutant concentrations in soils is often limited. For some pollutants, such as metals and PAH’s, there is a natural background component to the total amount present (see also factsheet P13). 4.2.1 Soil erosion In Comber (2021), the background concentrations of metals from natural soils are used to estimate the loads to surface waters from natural erosion processes. The Foregs database (19) provides natural background concentrations across numerous countries (Table 4.1). The soil losses are available from an extensive database on soil loss across the EU in Eurostat (2021c) (20). Eurostat (2021d) also provides the amount of agricultural area per country (21). Metal losses to water can therefore be calculated by multiplying the soil loss by the metal concentration in the soilTable 4.2). Comber (2021) calculates (Table 4.2) that all the soil loss will end up in the surface water as a worst-case assumption (so %sw in Equation 4.1 is 100 %). There are indications from DE that only a 6 % of the soil loss, especially the smallest particles, will reach the surface water (22). Borelli et al. (2018) gives a European average percentage of soil loss transferred to the riverine system of 15 %. Hungary reported an average sediment delivery ratio of 2.2 %, calculated by the",

Hungary reported an average sediment delivery ratio of 2.2 %, calculated by the MONERIS model (Behrendt, 2003; Jolánkai et al., 2015). Finland modelled erosion with the help of the RUSLE model (Lilja et al., 2013). Calculations are frequently based on the USLE (Universal Soil Loss Equation) approach, which describes the loss of soil from certain agricultural lands (Canadian Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs, 2015). The amount of erosion and the percentage reaching surface water vary remarkably between different study areas as it is very site-specific. In the case where no additional information is available, we advise to use the European average percentage of 15 % from Borelli et al. (2018).

      "text": "4.2.2 Leaching from agricultural soils In a European wide study, Eurometaux (Comber, 2021) mentioned pollutant loads to agricultural soils for selected metals (lead, cadmium and nickel) on a country level which can be used if more detailed national information is not available (Table 4.3). These (total) loads can be used as activity rates for pathways 2, 3, 4 and 5 in the different Member States. The loads to agricultural soils are the sum of the loads of different sources to agricultural land: • Natural background concentrations in soils (see Comber,2021 Table 6 and fact sheet P13 Natural background), • Fertilizer used o Sewage sludge (biosolids) calculation of loads to arable land based on the amount of sludge to land (ton/year/dry matter) used as fertilizer at country level and mean metal concentrations in sludge (mg/kg/dry matter) (see Comber, 2021 Table 1), o Inorganic P-fertilizer calculation of loads to arable land based on the amount of fertilizer used (kg P/day) and mean metal concentrations (mg/kg) in inorganic fertilizers (see Comber, 2021 Table 2) and o Farmyard manure (FYM), organic fertilizer calculation of loads to arable land based on mean concentrations in the manure (mg/kg) and animal numbers at country level for different animals (see Comber, 2021 Table 5). It has been assumed that all animal manure produced in a country is returned to the soil in the same country. Other types of organic fertilizers like compost and digestate from biowaste that are not mentioned here, were not taken into account because these are minor loads compared to the manure and because data is not easily available and comparable between countries. • Atmospheric deposition calculation of loads to arable land based on annual rainfall (mm), agricultural used area (km2) and metal concentrations in rainfall (ug/l) (see Comber, 2021 Table 8). This data only refers to wet deposition. The total load to agricultural land of the individual sources estimated by Comber is reported in kg/day in Table 4.4. The loads of the different sources can be found in Comber (2021, paragraph 2.1 – 2.6.) and in Annex P2-P5. These total loads can be used as activity rates for pathways 2",

No data available for Liechtenstein and Montenegro **Under UN Security Council Resolution 1244/99 4.2.3 Total sum of the emissions of metals to surface water There are two pathways for the loss of metals from agricultural land (Table 4.5): 1. Erosion, Soil loss A reported loss of soil multiplied by a concentration of metals (broadly speaking assumed to be particulate) depends on the agricultural practices. This should not be confused with the natural background of the soil (see chapter 4.2.1). 2. Leaching, total loss based on source inputs A calculated summed load applied per year from fertilisers and atmospheric deposition, multiplied by a proportion that is leached, rather than taken up into crops or adsorbed to the soil matrix (assumed to be mostly dissolved in nature). As can be seen in the table below, loss of metal associated with the soil is far higher than that leached from inputs, although the leached metal may be more bioavailable since it is assumed to be more in dissolved form.

If there is no surface water, the pesticides will stay in the soil and degrade with time, reach the atmosphere or leach into groundwater.

      "text": "It is difficult to find data of the percentage of used substances lost through drift and run-off to surface water. Therefore, below we present a number of examples, with estimations of percentage losses to surface water from different studies. In the Netherlands, the NMI model is used (Kruijne et al, 2012). In NMI different formulas are used to calculate the drift and run-off. For this, a lot of information is necessary, like the crop-free buffer zone, the distance between the top of the ditch bank and the centre of the first plant row, the distance between the last nozzle position and the last crop row, etc. Pesticide information is available about the percentage of the application that goes to air and surface water (drift, run-off). Three WFD substances are calculated in the model (Kruijne et al, 2021): aclonifen, bifenox and isoproturon. For the other WFD substances, a 95th percentile of 1.65 % of the pesticide loads to surface water was derived from the NMI-model (Table 4.8). The 95th percentile has been used to simulate a “worst case’’ scenario because the pesticide loads to surface water often occur as peak flows in wet circumstances. Table 4.8 Percentage of the total amount of pesticide sold reaching the surface water (derived from Kruijne et al, 2021) Average percentage of the amount of pesticide sold reaching the surface water Substance Drift Drain/Run-off Total Aclonifen 0.002 % 0.004 % 0.006 % Isoproturon 0.01 % 0.02 % 0.03 % Bifenox 0.04 % 3.70 % 3.74 % Other 0.05 % 1.60 % ( 1.65 % substances (95th percentile) 95th percentile) (95th percentile) In an American study (Kellogg et al, 2000), model runs give the 95th percentile loss as a percentage of the amount applied.

The reported total percentage of pesticides reaching the surface water is 5.1 %. Tiktak et al. (2002) distinguish four types of fluxes of pesticides to four surface waters in the Netherlands: rapid drainage at the soil surface, drainage system, saturated part of the soil and leaching into groundwater. The 95th percentile for the sum of the four fluxes, what will be more or less comparable to the sum of the pathways P2–P5, is 3.95 %. Siimes and Mehtonen (2021) describe a way to estimate agricultural pesticide losses from soil to surface water in Finland. Based on this method, Finland was able to include reporting of pesticide diffuse loading into the second Finnish WFD inventory of emissions. The loads of pesticides to surface water are based on the used amount of substance in the upper catchment area and the proportion of applied pesticide lost into surface water (as in method 1 described above). It was concluded that real loss fraction (via spray drift, surface runoff, erosion and drainage flow) varies in space and time. Values of losses to surface water range from below 0.1 % up to 2 % are reported for Northern European areas (e.g. Kreuger 1998, Laitinen et al. 2000, Siimes et al. 2005, Kreuger & Adielsson 2008). An estimation of the substance use in the upper basin area was based on cultivation areas of relevant crops and typical pesticide usage on these crops. The typical values were taken from the national pesticide usage statistics for almost 20 crops from about 5000 farms, but expert assessments were needed to assess Calculating emissions to water – a simplified method 35\n\nSubstance | Average percentage of the amount of pesticide sold reaching the surface water | | | Drift | Drain/Run-off | Total Aclonifen | 0.002 % | 0.004 % | 0.006 % Isoproturon | 0.01 % | 0.02 % | 0.03 % Bifenox | 0.04 % | 3.70 % | 3.74 % Other substances | 0.05 % (95th percentile) | 1.60 % ( 95th percentile)",

      "text": "missing pesticide usage values for several crops. In the first WFD emission inventory, for MCPA (2-Methyl- 4-ChlorPhenoxyAcetic) a loss fraction of 0.16 % has been used as a mean value of a range from 0 to 0.48 %. In the second WFD emission inventory, a value of 0.5 % was used as the loss fraction for all agricultural pesticides. A general value was needed because reliable loss fractions were not possible to calculate for all relevant substances due to limited monitoring data (number of samples and detection limits found in monitoring data). The selected value of 0.5 % was estimated to be realistic, but more likely too high than too small in most cases (substance, site & hydrological year). Calculated loads were compared with river loads based on measured concentrations and river flows and appeared within the same range. It was seen as a problem that, as in other countries, pesticide sale statistics are confidential at substance level, if less than three companies are producing product including the substance. From the different literature, a generic worst-case range (using the 95th percentile) for the percentage of pesticides used ending up in the surface water can be derived, which ranges from 0 %, where no surface water is present, to 5 % as a maximum. Combined with data or rough estimations of pesticide sale or use, this percentage can be used to give a first indication of pesticide loads to surface waters. 4.4 Conclusions Metals and pesticides from agricultural land can reach the surface water by one or more of the pathways P2 to P5. Many factors influence the transport to surface waters both for metals and pesticides, such as timing and intensity of precipitation, hydrology, area ratios, and the general presence of surface water bodies. We have chosen to discuss these pathways together because the loads to surface waters are related, and without detailed models, it is not possible to distinguish between them. To provide a first approximation, the method uses estimation of land-based sources combined with the averaged loss (as a proportion of the total) to surface water.

      "text": "5 Surface run-off from sealed areas (P6) 5.1 Introduction In urban areas, not all impervious surfaces are connected to the sewer system (separate or combined) (Figure 5.1). Consequently, deposited pollutants on impervious surfaces are washed off and transported to permeable areas with vegetation or bare soils, where water possibly infiltrates or discharges with the overflow directly into surface waters. P6 only considers the emissions transported with the surface run- off (overflow) from impervious (sealed) areas directly to surface waters. This pathway includes run-off from off-site roads like highways and intra-urban impervious surfaces. Figure 5.1: Schematic overview of emissions to surface waters via surface run-off from sealed areas not connected to sewer systems In case of run-off from surfaces not connected to the sewer system, it is hard to differentiate if run-off reaches the surface water network or infiltrates into neighbouring unsealed surfaces (see P3, section 4.1.2). Even if impervious areas are connected to the sewer system (see P7, section 6), the situation might be different in other countries and landscapes (e.g. mountain areas). For bigger cities, it might be assumed that most impervious areas are connected to sewers, and if not, that water evaporates or the run-off infiltrates and pollutants are emitted to soils, retained there or washed out into groundwater. Consequently, this pollution load is included in P4 (groundwater). It can be assumed that most of the surface run-off infiltrates into soils and does not reach surface waters directly, except locally during heavy rain fall events. In most areas this pathway for loads transported to surface waters is usually not significant, in comparison to those e.g. via erosion or groundwater discharge. To calculate loads, it is necessary to have information about annual stormwater run-off volume. In most countries this information (volume of stormwater) is not known at river basin or even at national level. To estimate loads on a local level a simplified method can be applied. At local level, specific loads in surface waters arising from storm water run-off from impervious surfaces not connected to sewers can be estimated, based on substance concentrations at the storm water outlet, using Equation 5.1.

The mean run-off coefficient for urban areas can be assumed to be 0.6 as a first approximation. If more detailed national or catchment specific information is available that value should be used.

      "text": "6 Stormwater outlets/combined sewer overflows/unconnected sewers (P7) 6.1 Introduction The urban wastewater system collects domestic (37) and commercial wastewater as well as storm water from impervious surfaces connected to the sewer system. Thereby, a variety of pollutants reach the sewers coming from many different sources in urban areas such as households (e.g. domestic chemicals, pharmaceuticals), traffic (e.g. combustion processes, tyre wear particles, brake abrasion), construction materials (e.g. for roofs or gutters), facade coatings (wall paint), atmospheric deposition etc. In principle two different sewer systems can be distinguished: • Separate sewer systems (see Figure 6.1) with o separate storm water sewer and o separate urban waste water sewer • Combined sewer systems (see Figure 6.2) collecting both storm water and urban wastewater in one channel. Storm water run-off from impervious areas flushes all particulate substances deposited on top of the impervious area, as well as dissolved substances detached from construction materials (e.g. from roof tiling and façade coating) into sewers. In a separate sewer system, the resulting pollutant load is usually directly released into the next water body. In some cases, the stormwater is treated in e.g. sedimentation tanks, infiltration systems or retention soil filter systems before. For combined sewer systems, an additional pollutant load from untreated urban waste water is emitted into surface waters during combined sewer overflows. The overflowing water is therefore a mix of substances from domestic and industrial/commercial wastewater and deposits from impervious surfaces. As a result, high pollutant concentrations may temporarily occur specially in small receiving waters, affecting sensitive organisms and possibly being responsible for failing good ecological and chemical status under Water Framework Directive (WFD). Main pollutants in storm water outlets and combined sewer overflows are: • Metals • Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs) • Perfluorocarbons (PFC) • Biocides • Pharmaceuticals • And others e.g. DEHP, TBT or Nonylphenol. Due to unconnected sewers in both sewer systems, a certain share of inhabitants is not connected to Urban Waste Water Treatment Plants (UWWTP) and are emitting mainly the dissolved share of the urban wastewater into surface waters. (37) Domestic wastewater under Urban Waste Water Treatment Directive (UWWTD) is defined as: “… waste water from residential settlements and services which originates predominantly from the human metabolism and from household",

      "text": "As described above, P7 includes three sub-pathways of wastewater collected in sewer systems but not treated in UWWTPs (see Figure 6.1 and Figure 6.2): • P7a: storm water outlets, SWO (separate storm water sewers), • P7b: combined sewer overflows, CSO (combined sewers), when rainfall exceeds the capacity of the combined sewer system and the UWWTP and untreated waste water are discharged directly to surface waters and • P7c: unconnected sewers (separate urban wastewater sewers and combined sewers not connected to UWWTPs). The main objective of this factsheet is to provide information on substance emissions from urban sewers (storm water outlets, combined sewer overflows and unconnected sewers). Surface run-off from impervious areas, which are not connected to either a combined or a separate sewer system (related to P6 (see Figure 6.1 and Figure 6.2)), is very likely to infiltrate and not reach the surface water. Considering the purification capacity of soil and the distance/connection to receiving surface waters, this pathway is not seen as an important source of direct surface water pollution. 6.2 Calculation methods The total loads considered in P7 are the sum of the loads emitted via the sub-pathways storm water outlets (P7a), combined sewer overflows (P7b) and unconnected sewers (P7c) (see Equation 6.1): Equation 6.1 Total load emitted to surface waters via sewage systems (storm water outlets, combined sewer overflows and unconnected sewers) 𝐿 = 𝐿 +𝐿 +𝐿 𝑃7 𝑠𝑤𝑜 𝑐𝑠𝑜 𝑛𝑐 where: L = total load from sewer systems (storm water outlets, combined sewer overflows P7 and unconnected sewers) L = annual pollutant load emitted via storm water outlets SWO (kg/a); P7a swo L = annual pollutant load emitted via combined sewer overflows CSO (kg/a); P7b cso L = annual pollutant load emitted via unconnected sewers (kg/a); P7c nc To calculate emissions from urban sewers, different calculation methods can be used, depending on the availability of information and data.

If that information is not available, data from the EU-UWWTD referring to unconnected sewers could be used at least to estimate the proportion (connected sewers/unconnected sewers), even if data don’t allow the differentiation between unconnected combined sewers and separate domestic wastewater sewers (see fact sheet P9). Under UWWTD Member States report the rate ( %) of generated load (person equivalent (p.e.)) in agglomerations (41) > 2,000 p.e. Average annual overflow rate (Rover): In Germany, during the duration period of one year, approximately 50 % of surface run-off from impervious surfaces discharged into surface waters (R = 0.5). These overflow events released between over 1 – 2 % of the additional annual municipal wastewater flow. To calculate loads in surface water via combined sewer overflows, Comber et al. (2021) also derived as a first approximation loads at country level (Annex P7 Table A P7.4). It needs to be mentioned that more specific data/information is needed to improve the given values. 6.2.3 Loads from unconnected sewers (P7c) In general, the total load from unconnected sewers is the sum of loads from combined and separate domestic wastewater sewers not connected to UWWTPs (see Figure 6.1 and Figure 6.2 and Equation 6.8).

Generally, it can be assumed that information/data to differentiate between the different sewer systems is barely possible. Therefore, a simplified method is presented. As a first step, annual pollutant loads, generated by inhabitants connected to sewers but not connected to UWWTPs, needs to be calculated according to Equation 6.9 (see also fact sheet P9).

Because the values already refer to treated wastewater, further retention (see Equation 3) should not be considered. 6.3 Conclusions There are possibilities to estimate emissions in surface waters via storm water outlets, combined sewer overflows and unconnected sewers, even if at national level data is rarely available. A quite simple calculation method is described. Several European data sets are available and mean concentration values for metals are provided as well as examples from several studies. All this information can be used to calculate emissions for this pathway even if it might be just a first approximation. Calculating emissions to water – a simplified method 54",

      "text": "7 Urban waste water treated (P8) 7.1 Introduction Point sources such as urban wastewater treatment plants (UWWTPs) can be important sources for emissions to water. In particular, the urban wastewater system collects a variety of pollutants coming from many different sources in urban areas such as households or industrial facilities (e.g. domestic chemicals, pharmaceuticals), traffic (e.g. combustion processes), facade coatings (e.g. wall paint), etc. For quantifying feasible input loads, reliable monitoring data are needed. Even if some pollutants are frequently monitored and well-reported for UWWTPs, there still is a lack of data and information for many pollutants outside the scope of routine national monitoring programmes, especially where those are present at very low concentrations in urban wastewater, which can require complex analytical chemical techniques. The main objective of this factsheet is to provide recent information on emissions from UWWTPs. This document focuses on the first step into substances under the EQS-Directive. The aim is to support countries with monitoring information for quantifying at least effluent emissions from ideally all UWWTPs at country or River Basin District (RBD) level for selected relevant substances. Such information can generally be difficult to obtain. The information should be appropriate to give a more reliable and complete picture of emissions from all UWWTPs. In earlier studies, gap-filling focused on more frequently monitored pollutants (e.g. nutrients, metals and DEHP; (Roovaart and Duijnhoven, 2018). These calculations were based on information reported under the E-PRTR, and even these pollutants (metals and DEHP) seemed to be underreported in the E-PRTR. The capacity threshold for UWWTP (100,000 population equivalent (p.e.) in the E-PRTR means that plants below that capacity are not required to report under E-PRTR, while there are also pollutant thresholds (Annex II of the EPRTR Regulation) below which releases do not need to be reported. Note that at the time of writing (November 2022) both the E-PRTR and the UWWT Directive are under revision. 7.2 Calculation methods Depending on the availability of information for calculating UWWTP effluent loads, two different approaches can be applied: 1. Using UWWTP effluent concentrations and effluent flows 2. Using emission factors (EF) and a proxy variable to which the EF refers to (e.g. treated p.e.,",

Related to the WFD priority substances (48), several monitoring campaigns for different countries with a varying number of UWWTPs were found. Results of the literature check on monitoring information identified three different groups of pollutants (A, B and C). A) Several substances were measured in a number of monitoring programs/studies. Most studies found this group of substances in a large number of samples with varying mean/median concentrations (Table 7.1 and Annex P8). For some substances monitoring results vary significantly between different studies and Member States. In a few studies, some substances can be found quite often in UWWTP effluents while in other studies they cannot be found with values > LoQ. Reasons might be: • emissions are caused by regional or even local conditions/emission situations, • special selection of UWWTPs, • differing monitoring strategies related to sampling procedures, for instance, frequency, timeframe (short-term or long-term samples) and preparation of samples, and • differing analytical methods applied, for instance, regarding sensitivity (LoD/LoQ) or analysing of dissolved or total concentration.

Mean effluent concentrations In some cases, mean concentrations highly differ between different monitoring studies (see Annex P8). Reasons might be: • a specific national or local emission situation; • differences in applied sampling strategies; • differences in applied analytical methods, especially concerning sensitivity (LoQ) etc. Statistical values derived from monitoring studies refer to the whole group of investigated UWWTPs in each study. More detailed information about UWWTPs (meta-data like size or treatment type) were not available for all studies. Therefore, further differentiation between, for instance, treatment types, was not possible. Bearing this in mind, calculated UWWTP effluent loads using the average concentrations derived from all these different studies (based on median concentration values of the different studies) should only be seen as a first approximation. Regional peculiarities or even special situations for single UWWTPs (regarding e.g. treatment type, sewage composition) are not considered. Nevertheless, where no other data are available, the loads calculated using the derived mean concentrations should provide an indication of the relevance of UWWTPs as an emission pathway to surface waters.

These factors refer to UWWTPs with secondary and tertiary levels of treatment. Further differentiation for treatment types was not possible based on the available information. Both UWWTPs equipped with primary level treatment only and those with more advanced levels of treatment (e.g. targeted micropollutant elimination such as activated-carbon filter or ozonisation) are not represented in the listed studies. In most EU countries, the number of UWWTPs with treatment levels beyond tertiary is limited. On the other hand, urban wastewater treatment has improved in all parts of Europe over the last 30–40 years (EEA 2020). In 2017, most European countries collected and treated sewage to tertiary level from most of their population. In the EU-27 countries, 69 % of the population were connected to tertiary level treatment and 13 % to only secondary level treatment (EEA 2020). Nevertheless, in Roovaart and Duijnhoven (2018) emission factors for UWWTPs with only primary level treatment had been derived even if it was based on a very limited number of plants. That is why the results of Roovaart and Duijnhoven (2018) are less reliable. The available emission factors also may differ quite a lot (We don´t want to give a recommendation on which values should be used. Users need to assess what is relevant to use in their own situation based e.g., on the individual situation in the country. Table 7.6 and Annex P8).

Based on the results of the literature check for a small number of “priority substances”, recommendations for average UWWTP effluent concentrations to calculate UWWTP effluent loads can be given. For the remaining priority substances, mean concentrations have not been provided due to the lack of sufficient information for some priority substances, while for others, UWWTPs do not seem to be a relevant pathway to surface waters. For a small number of priority substances, examples for MS specific emission factors can be given. 7.3 Conclusions Urban wastewater treatment plants can be seen as a relevant source of emissions to water for a large number of pollutants. In this fact sheet, two methods are given for the quantification of the loads to surface water based on literature references. Mean effluent concentrations have been derived for 11 priority substances from 12 monitoring studies in Europe covering 18 Member States. Combined with annual treated wastewater flows per RBD or country, a total annual load of these pollutants can be calculated. As an alternative method, mean emission factors (mg/p.e./year) were derived from a limited number of literature studies for 11 pollutants, which can be combined with the annually treated amount of wastewater per UWWTP/in the RBD or country (p.e./year) to calculate the total loads to surface water. In the Annex P8, detailed information is given, both about the pollutants with enough data to derive mean effluent concentration or emission factors, and about less frequently monitored pollutants.

      "text": "8 Individual – treated and untreated – household discharges (P9) 8.1 Introduction “In 2017, approximately 11 % of the EU population was not connected to wastewater collection” (Grebot et al., 2019). The fate and destination of sewage discharges from such households are considered in legislation, though naming and definitions may differ: • In the WFD, they are termed ‘non-connected dwellings’ (57) (2000/60/EC), • In the UWWTD, the term used is ‘individual appropriate systems (IAS) (58)’ (91/271/EEC) and • Under the HELCOM reporting for the Baltic Sea, the term is ‘scattered dwellings’ (59) (Helsinki Commission). The main similarity between these definitions is to look at generated and treated or untreated wastewater which is not collected in centralised systems. This factsheet also considers the direct discharges of mainly domestic (60) wastewater from residential settlements/individual households neither connected to a sewer system or to an urban wastewater treatment plant (UWWTP) (see Figure 8.1). Such emissions do not include non-domestic emissions from small-scale industry. Under the UWWTD, where a collecting system is not in place, either because it would produce no environmental benefit or because it would involve excessive cost, individual private and appropriate treatment systems, e.g. package plants or contained systems (e.g. wastewater storage tanks (impervious without outlet)), should be established (Figure 8.1 paths I2 and I4). These individual systems should be appropriate and achieve the same level of environmental protection as urban wastewater discharges (e.g.) (Grebot et al. 2019). Contained systems like wastewater storage tanks (impervious without outlet) should be periodically emptied and the wastewater taken to an UWWTP and treated. These individual systems don´t need to be further considered for P9, as these pollutant loads are included in P8 (urban wastewater treated). IAS like package plants (Figure 8.1, path I2) should receive raw sewage undiluted by runoff, which then separates into solids and liquids (Comber 2021, Grebot et al. 2019). Solids settle on the bottom of the tank or in a separate vault and are periodically removed as sludge and taken to an UWWTP. Liquids flow out of the system and drain, e.g. directly into the soil in which case they",

Solids settle on the bottom of the tank or in a separate vault and are periodically removed as sludge and taken to an UWWTP. Liquids flow out of the system and drain, e.g. directly into the soil in which case they don’t have to be considered for P9. If liquids discharge directly to a surface water body, they need to be considered for P9. However, a certain portion of the individual households has no appropriate systems, which means that the untreated domestic wastewater and its pollutant loads are directly discharged to surface waters or probably in most cases infiltrate into soil (see Figure 1, paths I1 and I3). An example is a seepage pit, which drains directly into the soil without any further treatment (Figure 1; path I1). Seepage pits are still quite common in some parts of Europe or in prospective EU-Member States (MS). But since there is no direct connection to the surface water, seepage pits should not be considered for P9. The wastewater (liquids) leaches and pollutants may reach the groundwater (diffuse pollution). Therefore, it is related to the groundwater pathway (P4). If the untreated wastewater discharges directly to surface waters it needs to (57) non-connected dwellings: “…dwellings not connected to a central wastewater collection system. In many cases, these dwellings apply on-site wastewater treatment systems known as individual or other appropriate systems (IAS). Alternatively, they apply no treatment at all.” (Grebot et al. 2019, p. 9) (58) appropriate treatment under UWWTD means: “…treatment of urban wastewater by any process and/or disposal system which after discharge allows the receiving waters to meet the relevant quality objectives and the relevant provisions of this and other Community Directives” (59) scattered dwellings: “…on-site wastewater systems which receive domestic or similar wastewater from single family homes, small businesses or settlements outside urban wastewater collection systems…” (HELCOM RECOMMENDATION 28E/6) (60) Domestic wastewater under UWWTD is defined as: “… waste water from residential settlements and services which originates predominantly from human metabolism and from household activities” Calculating emissions to water – a simplified method 66",

Unconnected sewers are not considered for P9 but are included in P7. Figure 8.1: Scheme of individual household discharges (treated and untreated) to surface waters. Domestic wastewater originates from dwellings, offices and shops etc. The water primarily comprises tap water used for toilet flushing, cleaning, cooking, dish and clothes washing etc. Main pollutant sources are human excretion (faeces, urine), emissions due to corrosion of the pipe system, food remains, dishwasher detergent, cleaning agents and emissions from diverse household and personal products. Therefore, domestic wastewater contains a mixture of different potential WFD substances such as: • Metals • PAHs • Perfluorocarbons (PFC) • Biocides • Pharmaceuticals • and others e.g. DEHP, TBT or Nonylphenol.

IAS under UWWTD comprise septic tanks or package plants where wastewater is treated, or wastewater tanks without an outlet where the wastewater is periodically transported to UWWTPs (Grebot et al. 2019). MS report the rate of generated load of an agglomeration which is transported to UWWTP by trucks. Therefore, for each agglomeration the number of p.e.

Nevertheless, the approach proposed can provide a first approximation.

Examples are given in Annex P9. Depending on the substance reduction, efficiencies highly vary. Based on the given examples in Annex P9 (monitoring results) it can be assumed that the treatment efficiency is at least comparable to a secondary treatment phase: • For metals listed in the EQS-Directive (Cd, Hg, Ni, Pb) the removal efficiency increases as follows Ni < Hg < Cd ≤ Pb o for cadmium and lead removal efficiency is around 90 % and higher, o for mercury removal efficiency is between 80 and 90 %, o for nickel removal efficiency is lower than 50 % (25 – 44 %). • For pesticides Diuron, Isoproturon and Terbutryn the reduction efficiency is expected to be < 50 % and ranges between zero (no reduction) and approximately 50 %. • For PFOS reduction efficiency ranges between around 40 % and 70 %. • For Nonylphenol and DEHP reduction efficiency ranges between 60 % and > 90 %.

In Europe this pathway is already covered by reporting under: • EU – The European Pollutant Release and Transfer Register (E-PRTR) (65) • Eionet countries – The Water Information System for Europe for the State of the Environment on Emissions (WISE SoE – Emissions) (66). These two databases are publicly available and can be used in an emission inventory as basis for the industrial emissions to water. 9.2 Calculation methods 9.2.1 E-PRTR The E-PRTR contains data from large sources, either industry or UWWTPs serving over 100,000 people. In theory, all emissions to water are reported on a yearly basis by the Member States under three conditions: 1. They fall under the activities selected for reporting in the E-PRTR, 2. They are released from activities with capacities above the capacity thresholds mentioned in the E- PRTR and 3. The loads are above the pollutant thresholds mentioned in the E-PRTR. E-PRTR aims to cover 90 % of emissions to water. If no additional information is available from the remaining 10 % per MS, only data from E-PRTR can be used. Data have been reported under this EU obligation since 2007. In E-PRTR, both the loads directly to surface water and the indirect loads (to a wastewater treatment plant) need to be reported. The indirect loads are covered under P8. Only the loads directly to surface water are included in P10. In Annex P10 a summary of the E-PRTR calculation method for loads to surface water is described. For reporting, the measured, calculated, or estimated value of a release is relevant. The pollutant only has to be reported, if the amount of the pollutant released is equal to or above the threshold value. The total and eventually accidental releases are reported in kg/year at facility level. The European industrial emissions portal (67) presents information on the largest industrial complexes in Europe. In its analysis viewer (68), it shows different views on pollutants per country and sector.

The data have been reported by Eionet countries, compiled and processed by the ETC/ICM and EEA. The scope for reporting is on the River Basin District (RBD) or at national level for the total load of industrial loads to surface water. No restrictions are made for activities of the industry, capacity or pollutant threshold values. Diffuse sources and UWWTPs from WISE are not included in P10 but are related to other pathways. For WISE (69) the releases to surface water are added up to a RBD per pollutant per year. Point sources for industrial wastewater are divided up into treated and untreated wastewater. The WISE emissions dataset is available from the EEA website (70). The dataset contains a time series of the emissions of nutrients and hazardous substances to water, reported by EEA member countries and cooperating countries. 9.3 Conclusions Although the existing E-PRTR gives a good overview of the existing data of loads to surface water from the industrial activities under E-PRTR, it might be useful for MS to check if additional data is available from the industry itself, from enforcing authorities or from project datasets. When relevant, data could be added to this pathway about: • loads of pollutants not covered by the E-PRTR • loads of pollutants from activities not covered by the E-PRTR • loads from activities below the E-PRTR capacity thresholds • loads from pollutants below the E-PRTR pollutant thresholds This extra information could be reported to WISE-1, although such information is limited at present. Adding this extra information would result in a more complete report of industrial loads to surface water in Europe.

      "text": "10 Direct discharges from mining (P11) 10.1 Introduction Direct discharges from mining considered in this factsheet are only from former mines. Typically, such sources are in the form of abandoned non-coal mine levels and adits (horizontal passages into the side of a mountain or ridge), and occasionally mine shafts. The direct discharges from mining include measurable (volume and concentrations) discharges only, other diffuse discharges are not accounted for. Discharges or losses of pollutants as a result of operational mining activities should be reported under the E-PRTR Regulation as Annex I Activities: 3 (a) Underground mining and related operations or 3 (b) Opencast mining and quarrying. They are not included here. For this factsheet we only consider metals defined as priority substances under the WFD: cadmium (Cd), lead (Pb), nickel (Ni) and mercury (Hg). Direct discharge is emission directly into surface water bodies. In this pathway, loads as a result of the natural background of metals are also included, because significant metal fluxes are from areas with ore deposits and these deposits were (or are) also extracted. However, metal flux from ore deposits without mining are lower than from abandoned mines. Another important factor is acidification because acid water dissolves metals from rocks. The contribution of diffuse (indirect) mine water pollution, particularly during high flow conditions, are not included here, but they can be significant. 10.2 Calculation methods The calculation approach used was from the Environment Agency UK documents (Prioritisation) and it was adapted for this general document (Environment Agency UK, 2012). It is not possible to use any European emission factor due to specific conditions in Member States. In cases where there are too many abandoned mines, it is not necessary to calculate metal fluxes from all of them, but we need to identify the catchments with potential significant metal discharges from mining. We can use monitored metal data in surface water and/or information about abandoned non-coal mines – the combination of both is the best option. As a first step, we should select the catchments with relevant metals, with confirmed former non-coal mines, with a poor chemical status. The second step is the prioritisation of water bodies affected by non-coal mines, where the impact on surface water quality, groundwater quality, water resources and ecology should be assessed, if information are available. The next step should be to calculate metal flux from the mines, so if too many catch",

The next step should be to calculate metal flux from the mines, so if too many catchments were selected, we could use another prioritisation – e.g. catchments with an existing negative impact on biological quality elements and/or human health. The final step is the formulation of priority lists with technical summaries of mining sites that are prone to the risks of mine water outbreaks and mining sites with surface waste issues that are connected to the Mining Waste Directive (Environment Agency UK, 2012). Another method for the prioritisation of mining sites is implemented by Ireland, where mining districts and sites are assigned to one of five classes with the help of a scoring system. The scoring system counts hazards, the likelihood of release and takes the receptors into account.

      "text": "The metal flux from the abandoned mines should be calculated from concentration data and flowrate. The water flow can be measured or estimated on the basis of the amount of precipitation. The monitoring should be done under varying hydrological conditions, but preliminary a sampling and analysis campaign is recommended during baseflow conditions (if feasible). For more detailed information see: https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/prioritisation-of-abandoned-non-coal-mine-impacts-on- the-environment. Data about the content of metals in subsoils and water are available in the Statistical data from the Geochemical Atlas of Europe – a geochemical baseline across Europe (FOREGS) and can be used as a rough source of information about how much of the metals could be leached from former mines. Because mines are situated in areas with a higher content of metals in the rock, the 90th percentile seems to be the better statistic to use rather than the median or mean. However, if countries did not include these specific areas into the FOREGS data, the value can be underestimated for historical mines. 10.3 Conclusions The simple estimation of emissions from former mining in surface waters is very difficult due to specific conditions in Member States. In this pathway, loads as a result of the natural background of metals are included, because significant metal fluxes are from areas with ore deposits and these deposits were also extracted. However, metal fluxes from abandoned mines are likely to be higher than fluxes from ore deposits where there has been no mining. Flux calculations from former mining areas should preferably be informed by the monitoring of flow rates and metal concentrations. If the data is missing, the European and national data sets of metal content in subsoils and water are available. This information can be used to estimate emissions from historical mining, but without monitored data it will be a rough approximation only. Calculating emissions to water – a simplified method 78",

      "text": "11 Inland navigation (P12) 11.1 Introduction In this factsheet a method for the calculation of diffuse emissions resulting from inland navigation is described. Inland navigation comprises shipping activities for goods transport that are categorised into national and international navigation. Here, inland navigation is defined as all shipping (both national and international) activity on inland waters per country. This factsheet does not include recreational vessels and seagoing vessels. This factsheet focuses on PAHs because for other substances (like TBT and copper) not enough data on regulation, use and emission factors is available. Professional inland vessels cause losses of PAHs to surface water as a result of the following sources: • Coatings (paint products applied to vessels). Ships’ outer hulls are fitted with coatings to protect them against organisms growing on the hull. PAH-components and metals in the paint products leach out into the surrounding surface water, leading to diffuse emissions into surface waters. • Bilge water. Ships unintentionally collect bilge water (the bilge is the lowest compartment on a ship) while traveling. Bilge water is often contaminated with oil containing PAHs. Although boat masters are required to collect and deliver the bilge water, it is assumed that a certain amount is still discharged illegally, leading to diffuse emissions of PAHs into surface waters. • Oil spills of cargo and fuels. Oil spills are the result of accidental and intentional discharges of liquid waste. Spills are caused by a series of incidents and events, in some cases intentionally. The nature of the spilled material varies from mineral oils such as fuels and greases to watery oil emulsions. 11.2 Calculation methods The emissions are calculated for inland vessels. Emissions are calculated by multiplying an activity rate (AR), in the case of inland navigation the number of ton-kilometres (tkm) traversed by all professional vessels on inland waters within a country/river basin, by an emission factor (EF), expressed in emission per AR unit.

It represents activities of vessels on inland waters and because it is assumed that the numbers are available for most EU Member States. There is no distinction between different types of inland vessels. Emissions are calculated for the inland navigation sector as a whole.

The generic method shown here uses Dutch data, dividing the 2019 emissions by the number of ton- kilometres traversed (ER, 2021). In this way, an implied emission factor for inland navigation has been derived. Emissions and ton-kilometres were obtained from the Dutch factsheets ‘Coatings, inland navigation’, ‘Oil spills by inland navigation’ and ‘Discharges of bilge water by inland navigation’ (Netherlands National Water Board – Water Unit, 2016a, 2016b, 2016c). Dutch references report emissions that were calculated with data obtained from (inter)national literature sources. Therefore, it is assumed that the derived implied emission factors are suitable for the calculation of diffuse emissions in the EU. The methodology for the three sources is described in detail in the Netherlands National Water Board (2016a, 2016b, 2016c).

The following is a brief description of how the emissions were calculated: • Coatings. Emissions for leaching from coatings are calculated by a simple method which involves multiplying an activity rate (AR), in this case the \"wet surface area x route covered\" of inland vessels on country specific routes, by an emission factor (EF) per substance, expressed in emission per unit of AR. The occurrence of PAH-based coatings also plays an important role in this respect. • Bilge water.

The PAH emission is then derived from the assumed PAH content in the used mineral oil. • Oil spills. The emissions are calculated based on the recorded quantity of spills annually. In this derivation, the activity rate (AR) is the annually registered spilled quantity of mineral oil (kg). The emission factors (EF) for the assumed PAH content (fresh oil) are expressed in g/kg of the AR. To obtain emission factors per pollutant, emissions for all sources, mentioned in the Dutch references, were added up and divided by the number of ton-kilometres on Dutch inland waters so that emission factors representative for the sum of all three sources are compiled.

Accordingly, these emissions are directly (100 %) released into surface waters. Emissions of bilge water are assumed to be partly collected and partly released into surface waters. Collected bilge water is usually treated; the pollutants therein are not released into the environment. The discharged part (EF for bilge water, Table 11.2) however, is assumed to be directly released into surface waters, as well as oil spills. Therefore, the emissions from inland navigation are 100 % released into surface waters. 11.3 Conclusions Due to the lack of data for other substances, only PAHs are considered in this factsheet. Emission factors described are derived from international literature, used for the Netherlands and have also been applied in the Rhine catchment. The emission factors can also be applied to RBDs in other countries. In the case where there should be more (country specific) information available on the use of PAH coatings, the collection of bilge water or the occurrence (amount and size) of oil spills, these can be adjusted.

      "text": "12 Natural background (P13) 12.1 Introduction The inventory of emissions, discharges and losses of priority and priority hazardous substances focuses on the identification and quantification of anthropogenic sources, although some substances also have a significant naturally occurring source at least in some areas (EU, 2012). Metals and Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs) can be released from natural sources or processes (e.g. geogenic background, soil genesis, volcanicity, storm, wildfire) (Wiłkomirski et al. 2018). Therefore, natural background is considered as a separate relevant pathway, representing the loads which would occur under pristine (72) conditions. But it needs to be considered that anthropogenic sources are usually much more significant. This work focuses on priority and priority hazardous substances, so it includes only specific metals (cadmium, nickel, lead and mercury) and PAHs e.g. as the sum of the 16 EPA (73) PAHs or benzo(a)pyrene (BaP). Information about natural background can be important in the context of planning measures. Natural background loads could be seen as the load which can´t be reduced by implementing measures. If the same substances are pollutants in a water body, it is necessary for river basin management planning to quantify the proportions of natural background and anthropogenic emissions. Natural background is in fact a rather complicated source because it is part of different diffuse pathways and double counting must be avoided. Metals are naturally parts of different rocks which might be rock aquifers as well as the base material for soils. The natural metal content depends on the rock constituents and affects the background concentration in soils and groundwater. Furthermore, because of volcanicity, fires and storm events, metals and PAHs can naturally end up in the atmosphere, are air-transported and finally deposited, both onto land and directly onto surface water. In that context e.g., natural metal and PAHs background concentrations can be directly part of the total diffuse load for the following diffuse pathways: • P1 – Atmospheric deposition directly to surface water. • P2 – Erosion (natural soil content and natural deposition). • P3 – Surface runoff from unsealed areas (mainly based on dry and wet atmospheric deposition). • P4 – Groundwater and interflow (based on natural rock and soil content). • P6 – Surface runoff from sealed areas (mainly based on dry and wet atmospheric deposition). • P11 – Direct Discharges from Mining (only relevant for",

To get reliable information, monitoring data are needed, and assumptions have to made to estimate natural background loads. Three different ways are described to get an impression of the natural background loads. (72) Related to a period without any anthropogenic activity.

The method is based on a river load approach established by OSPAR (2004) (Equation 12.1): Equation 12.1: River load approach to calculate natural background loads (LB) 𝐿 = 𝐿 − 𝐷 −𝐿𝐵+𝑁𝑃 𝐷𝑖𝑓𝑓 𝑦 𝑝 That means: 𝐿𝐵 = 𝐿 − 𝐷 − 𝐿 +𝑁𝑃 𝑦 𝑝 𝐷𝑖𝑓𝑓 where: L = is the total annual riverine load, y L = is the anthropogenic diffuse load, Diff D = is the total point source discharge, p LB = is the natural background load and NP = is the net outcome of in-river processes upstream of the monitoring point. The requirement to apply the described river load approach is that information on total anthropogenic diffuse loads and total point source loads is known. The main problem here is to calculate diffuse loads differentiated into anthropogenic and natural diffuse loads. Mohaupt et al. (2001) used this method to calculate natural background loads in the river discharge at RBD level (River Rhine). Known anthropogenic loads were e.g. the sum of industrial and communal discharges and storm water overflows. 12.2.2 Surface water data approach Another possibility available for the calculation of natural background loads is to use monitored natural background concentration values in surface waters (surface data approach). Knowing natural background concentrations might be also important for Member States when assessing the monitoring results against the relevant Environmental Quality Standard (EQS), especially when such concentrations prevent compliance with the relevant EQS (draft CIS Technical Guidance on Implementing Environmental Quality Standards (EQS) for Metals; 2019, unpublished (74)).

To estimate natural background concentrations on a regional scale, further information is needed. It should be kept in mind that even in undisturbed catchments, there is atmospheric deposition to surface waters. Using monitored concentrations and discharge data, natural background loads could be estimated/calculated on a catchment or sub-catchment scale (Equation 12.2). Equation 12.2: Natural background load (LB) calculation 𝐿𝐵 = 𝐶 ∗ 𝑄 𝑛𝑏 where: C = is the mean monitored natural background concentration (catchment/sub- nb catchment scale), Q = is the mean river discharge (catchment/sub-catchment scale). 12.2.3 Calculating pathway specific natural background loads For calculating pathway specific background loads, models can be used defining pristine scenarios. For the definition of such scenarios, many assumptions might be required, e.g. a value for a pristine atmospheric deposition. But it will have to be kept in mind that most processes like hydrology, erosion and surface runoff are anthropogenically affected themselves. Naturally – without any human activity – hydrological conditions, erosion and surface runoff would be completely different (no agriculture, natural vegetation etc.). The most important related pathways are described below. 12.2.4 Erosion To calculate natural background loads in surface waters by water erosion, complex input data (soil type and soil characteristics, climate, slope, management, etc.) and calculation methods are needed. Firstly, information on soil loss caused by water (surface runoff) is required to calculate emissions. Based on soil loss information, sediment transport to surface waters can be estimated. Depending on landscape characteristics like slope steepness, slope length, distance to surface waters and barriers (e.g. streets, land use pattern like tree rows or hedges) only a certain proportion of soil loss reaches surface waters. Most of the material is again deposited on land. The ratio between soil loss and sediment inputs to surface water is so called Sediment Delivery Ratio (SDR). If sediment transfer to surface waters is known, the concentrations of natural background concentration in the topsoil are used to calculate substance emission to surface waters.

That means heavily laden fine particles reach the surface water. The ratio between topsoil concentrations and the concentrations in the sediments entering the surface water is the Enrichment Ratio (ER). A description of methods and data availability is given in fact sheet P2-P5. Natural metal background concentrations in soils were considered by Comber (2021) in a European wide study to assess diffuse sources for the metals cadmium (Cd), nickel (Ni) and lead (Pb) to calculate emissions to water from natural erosion processes.

The FOREGS database is focused on sites with low anthropogenic input e.g. to target unamended soil and therefore reflects the natural geology of the different regions. To calculate the background loads from erosion processes, soil losses and sediment inputs to surface waters are needed (see also factsheet P2 Erosion). Ideally, information referring to pristine conditions (e.g. forested areas without any agricultural use) are used. Similar information for PAHs could not be identified, but Wiłkomirski et al. (2018) referred to different scientific studies. Monitored PAHs background concentrations in different studies ranges from 22 µg/kg up to around 3,700 µg/kg, especially in peat with a very high humus content. To give two national examples: For Austria, national topsoil concentrations for metals were derived based on monitoring data (Freudenschuß et al. 2007). The values are land use specific (forest, pasture and arable land). Monitoring data were analysed considering e.g. pH values, clay content, geology formation. The values are land use specific and regionalisation of topsoil concentration was carried out based on geological formations (bedrock for soil genesis). In Germany, the national working group LABO (Bund/Länder Arbeitsgemeinschaft Bodenschutz) for soil protection (LABO 2017) provide background concentrations including ubiquitous pollutant distribution for inorganic and organic substances like metals (e.g. Arsenic, Cadmium, Nickel, Lead, Mercury), B(a)P, PAH16, HCB, γ-HCH, Σ-HCH, PCB6, Σ-dl-PCB and Σ-PCDD/F (see also: https://geoviewer.bgr.de/mapapps4/resources/apps/geoviewer/index.html?lang=de). The values for metals are land use specific and regionalisation of topsoil concentration was carried out based on geological formations (bedrock for soil genesis). The values for PAHs are land use specific (field, pasture and forest) and differentiated by humus content classes.

EMEP provides atmospheric deposition data for metals (e.g. cadmium, lead and mercury) and the PAH benzo(a)pyrene (Chapter 3, Atmospheric deposition directly to surface water (P1)). EMEP modelling results contain natural background as well as anthropogenic emissions. A study by Richardson et al. (2001) provides further information about the global metal fluxes of Cd, Cu, Pb, Ni and Zn. 12.2.6 Groundwater, interflow and surface runoff from unsealed areas Natural background concentrations in groundwater are highly affected by the contents of the underlying geology. Concentrations in interflow and surface runoff from unsealed areas are affected by soil contents and atmospheric deposition (wet and dry). Data to calculate the natural background loads of these pathways is scarce. Nevertheless, if monitoring data are available, it could be used to derive loads from groundwater. Surface runoff from unsealed areas under pristine conditions should be highly affected by substance concentrations in rainwater. Calculating emissions to water – a simplified method 85",

Additional calculations are needed to convert the results of measurements into annual release data. For these calculations the results of flow determinations are needed. “M” should also be used when the annual releases are determined based on the results of short term and spot measurements. “M” is used when the releases of a facility are derived from direct monitoring results for specific processes at the facility, based on actual continuous or discontinuous measurements of pollutant concentrations for a given release route. Class C Release data are based on calculations (“C”). “C” is used when the releases are based on calculations using activity data (fuel used, production rate, etc.) and emission factors or mass balances. In some cases, more complicated calculation methods can be applied, using variables like temperature, global radiance etc. Class E Release data are based on non-standardised estimations (“E”). “E” is used when the releases are determined by best assumptions or expert guesses that are not based on publicly available references or in case of the absence of recognised emission estimation methodologies or good practice guidelines.
