The combustion of fuel, consumption of electricity, disposal of waste and the transportation of goods, materials and passengers are some of the activities that could be substantially contributing to a company’s air pollutant emissions. The contribution of the private sector has not been adequately quantified partly because there has been no guidance offering a comprehensive set of methods that would allow emissions from the various key sources along value chains to be identified and quantified. In this context, this Practical Guide for Business Air Pollutant Emission Assessment is intended to be used for quantification of air pollutant emissions of companies and businesses regardless of their size, product or service offered, and which industry they belong to. 4",

OVERVIEW OF AIR POLLUTION 2.1 Major air pollution sources negative impacts on human health when emitted and exposed.

Natural sources include volcanic 2.5 ozone (O ). According to the WHO, over 90% of people eruptions, sea spray, soil dust, natural vegetation fires and 3 live in regions that exceed the WHO guidelines levels of lightning. Anthropogenic sources can broadly be divided PM . Those exposed to the highest levels of air pollutants into stationary (e.g., such as power plants, oil refineries, 2.5 are often in low- and middle-income countries. Over the industrial facilities) and mobile (e.g., road transport, freight). past decades, air pollutant levels have decreased in some Some of the most common human-driven sources include regions, such as Europe, North America, and recently in power generation, transportation, industrial activities, China, and east Asia. However, in many regions air pollutant residential heating and cooking, agriculture, solvent use, concentrations continue to exceed national standards and oil and gas production, waste burning and construction. international guidelines. In addition, the WHO has recently For the majority of the world’s population, human activities revised its ambient air quality guidelines and the guideline account for most of the air pollution they are exposed to. levels for all pollutants have been reduced (World Health Organisation, 2021). For example, the new guideline for The magnitude of emissions of different pollutants varies ambient PM is 5 µg m-3, which is half of the previous by source. In cities, air pollutant concentrations are 2.5 value of 10.

Air pollution occurring from customer travel relates to the preferred and chosen mode of transport that the customer uses to arrive at the retailer, manufacturer, storage facility, collection point, or other company premises. For the user to estimate emissions related to the transport of their customers and staff, from and to their facilities they will need to have information on the number of customers (and/or staff) visiting their businesses and facilities. Because this Guide is using a distance travelled approach to estimate emissions related to customer travel, the user will also need to have an understanding and access to the average distance travelled for the customers and staff to get to their business by using different modes of transport (e.g., cars, buses, motorcycles, non-motorised). 29\n\nFuel\ncombustion\nemissions |  | \n-------------------------------\n | issions | \n |  | ssions\n |  | \n\n | Electricity\nGeneration\nemissions | \n--------------------------------------\n | emissions | \nemissio\nElectricity | emissio | \n |  | \n |  | \n\n |  | Emissions\nfrom Waste | \n-----------------------------\nfrom Wast\nWaste |  | from Wast | \n | Waste |  | \n |  |  | \n\n |  | \n------\nTransport\n(passenger and\ngoods) |  | \n | ) | \n |  | \n\nSource | Description | Methodology for quantifying\nemissions | Section with emission\nquantification\nmethodology\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n | Combustion of fossil fuels and/or biomass\nwithin retail component of value chain.\nExamples include diesel generators | Total fuel combusted multiplied by\npollutant- and/or technology-specific\nemission factors | \n | Electricity consumed during in retail\noperations (e.g. stores) that is generated\nfrom the combustion of fossil fuels and/or\nbiomass | Fuel combusted to generate electricity\nconsumed multiplied by pollutant- and/\nor technology-specific emission factors | \n | Emissions from freight transport during\nthe retail process (e.g. customer delivery)\nincluding road, rail, shipping and aviation\ntravel\nEmissions",

Confidence Interval The true value of the quantity for which the interval is to be estimated is a fixed but unknown constant. The confidence interval is a range that encloses the true value of this unknown fixed quantity with a specified confidence (probability). Typically, a 95 percent confidence interval is used in inventories. From a traditional statistical perspective, the 95 percent confidence interval has a 95 percent probability of enclosing the true but unknown value of the quantity. An alternative interpretation is that the confidence interval is a range that may safely be declared to be consistent with observed data or information. The 95 percent confidence interval is enclosed by the 2.5th and 97.5th percentiles of the PDF. Uncertainty Lack of knowledge of the true value of a variable that can be described as a PDF characterising the range and likelihood of possible values.
