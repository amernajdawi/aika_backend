Depending on the requirements of the monitoring programme it may be necessary to provide alternative samples such as replicates and duplicates. While this approach can be useful for assessing sampling homogeneity, there is a clear difference between replicate and duplicate samples, which becomes important when samples are being compared for regulatory purposes. The two terms are often interpreted as being identical but it is important where possible because it reduces errors arising from to distinguish which approach applies.

Webster apparent, despite applying the sensitizing rules described above. One means of improving this situation is to use a moving average chart (Fig.5.6) where the average value for, typically, the last four results is calculated and plotted sequentially. The first charted point would be results 1 to 4, the second 2 to 5 and so on. The larger the value of \u201cn\u201d (4 in this case), the greater the smoothing of variability, but the longer it takes to discern a pattern. If control limits are required these should be set to \u00b1 (2 \u00f7 \u221an) and \u00b1 (3 \u00f7 \u221an), respectively and recalculated as new results are input, until n = 6 at which point the control values remain constant. This approach is very common in financial analyses but is also quite well suited to laboratory analyses. 5.1.3 Range charts If the number of QC samples varies each time, the range of results can either be displayed on the Shewhart chart directly (as a vertical line through each plotted point) or on a separate R-chart (Range 31", "embedding_index": 64, "page_number": 41}, {"chunk_id": "e6e590b1-8b26-46aa-bbf5-c614cc817bf8_p42_c0", "text": "QUALITY ASSURANCE FOR FRESHWATER QUALITY MONITORING (typically more than 20), such as those obtained from BOX 5.2 EXAMPLE OF THE USE OF RANGE an automated analyser, it is generally considered good CHARTS practice to include at least one quality control sample per 20 test samples.

The top-down approach assumes that whatever the sources of variation, it may not be possible to say exactly how they interact or what is their relative contribution. The best guide as to how they all affect the results is to use routine analysis of an AQC sample or a Certified Reference Material (CRM) (see Chapter 4) because these will have been subject to the same elements of uncertainty (positive and negative) as real samples, at least as far as laboratory procedures are concerned. the aim would be to achieve better than a maximum Many national regulatory and accreditation bodies uncertainty of 20% comprising bias (10%) and have country-specific guidance on the application standard deviation (5%).

Acceptable limits should be set for all these metrics in the analysis protocol. In chromatographic methods, resolution is the degree to which one analyte can be distinguished from another. The resolution between the two chromatographic peaks shown in Fig. 9.3 is R , AB and is a quantitative measure of their separation. It is defined as 2 \u00d7 the time difference between the peaks (\u0394t) divided by the sum of the peak widths (w + w ). As R increases, the separation of the A B AB peaks improves (Fig. 9.3). Because resolution is a quantitative measure of the success of a separation, An analytical method is specific if its signal it is a useful way to determine if a change in responds only to the analyte.
