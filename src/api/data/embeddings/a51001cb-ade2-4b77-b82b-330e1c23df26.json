implemented in a digital template. The template reflects the VSME Standard as delivered by EFRAG to the European Commission on 17 December 2024. The template is accompanied by a digital VSME XBRL taxonomy, which represents the digital data model of the disclosures and is available on EFRAG's website. The VSME requires disclosure of comparative information on metrics (paragraph 12). This template enables reporting for one reporting period only. Therefore, it might be used for reporting in the first year only. It is expected that reporting solutions will enable the roll-forward of reporting periods, which would automatically provide the necessary comparative information.\\nThis template can be used for data entry and validation. By using an XBRL Converter on EFRAG's website, it can be saved as an XBRL report, in a free and open data format. Excel-named ranges are used to extract the disclosures. Value cells that",

      "page_number": null

    {
      "chunk_id": "a51001cb-ade2-4b77-b82b-330e1c23df26_t1",
      "text": " is expected that reporting solutions will enable the roll-forward of reporting periods, which would automatically provide the necessary comparative information.\\nThis template can be used for data entry and validation. By using an XBRL Converter on EFRAG's website, it can be saved as an XBRL report, in a free and open data format. Excel-named ranges are used to extract the disclosures. Value cells that are empty and do not have any value (neither text nor a number) will not be considered as reported and will not be included in the XBRL report when using the Excel-to-XBRL converter.\\nA few drop-down selection menus in the VSME have more than 100 entries (e.g. the NACE codes under B1, the list of pollutants under B4, the list of wastes under B7). In order to search in the list, users can simply start typing search keywords in the cell.\\nIf a security warning is shown, please \"Enable Content\" in order to allow automatic calculation of GPS coordinates for the list of sites under B1. No content other than the address entered will be sent to the internet and the contents shared with the provider can be found in the Nominatim Usage Policy (Geocoding Policy) and Privacy Policy.\\nAll materials developed by the EFRAG Secretariat are released for free and as open source (MIT license), which will enable any stakeholder to further enhance them and integrate them into commercial solutions. However, respecting the license conditions, the reference to EFRAG must be mentioned by the providers of those commercial solutions.

EFRAG assumes no responsibility or liability for the content or for any direct, indirect, or incidental consequences or damages resulting from the use of this fuel converter.\\nPlease note that the typical values for Net Calorific Value (NCV) and Density are provided for each fuel type. However, these parameters may vary depending on factors such as national regulations, specific characteristics of fuel providers, or other circumstances. Therefore, users are expected to manually enter or adjust the NCV and Density values to reflect their specific situation.\\nAdditionally, users are encouraged to determine the renewability status of each fuel based on Guarantees of Origin, as outlined in Article 19 of the European Directive 2018/2001/EC on the promotion of the use of energy from renewable sources. The default renewability status provided for each fuel is a typical assumption and should be adjusted if necessary, based on geographical or individual circumstances.

To do this please expand the hidden columns using the plus icon on the top of the document.\\nEach expanded fuel converter works exactly as explained above.\\n\\nIt’s important to note that the automatic calculation performed by the Fuel Converter is done using NCVs and Densities that are typical for that specific type of fuel. If the undertaking is able to provide the specific NCVs and Densities of the Fuels used, there is the possibility to calculate the Energy Consumption per Hour in MWh embedding the specific values in the formulas that are automatized in the Fuel Converter sheet.\\nBelow there are the formulas, just in case the solution of a not-automatized calculation using specific values is preferred to the one of the Converter. If you need to convert the Unit of Measurement of your specific measures, please use the Unit of Measurement Converter.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n\n=== Sheet: Fuel Conversion Parameters ===\nColumns: Fuels, State of matter, Typical NCV [TJ/Gg], Typical Density [kg/L], Typical Density [kg/m³], Typical renewability state, Mass, Volume, Energy, Mass and Volume, From → To, g/L, Kg/L, t/L, Gg/L, g/m³, Kg/m³, t/m³, Gg/m³,",
