Globally groundwater accounts for to ensure the programme generates meaningful approximately 26 per cent of total water abstractions (WWQA 2021). It is essential that groundwater resources are managed to ensure their quantity and Figure 1.1 The chain of activities in designing quality meet human needs and support freshwater and implementing a freshwater quality ecosystems. In arid regions where groundwaters are monitoring programme (adapted from the main source of freshwater supplies, concern has Chapman et al. 2005) mainly focussed on the amount of water available and on trying to manage the sustainable use of that water. There is growing evidence, however, that groundwaters are becoming contaminated and no longer meet required quality characteristics, potentially posing a threat to human health (WWQA 2021). The extent and nature of the contamination is unclear, due to the limited monitoring of groundwater quality at a global scale, especially in the Global South (WWQA 2021). In addition, the risk posed to human health from naturally occurring contaminants, such as arsenic and fluoride, are often unknown due to a lack of monitoring (WWQA 2021). Better information and understanding of groundwater will help to guide public health interventions, also in view of how contaminated water affects women, men and children in different ways. 1",

The results obtained through field and laboratory work need to be stored in a database that facilitates easy access and sharing of the data, in order to facilitate data analysis and presentation in a way that is useful for management purposes.

Percolation is the term used to describe the vertical water flow from the unsaturated zone into the saturated zone (i.e., into groundwater). Interflow is the lateral movement of water near the surface, in the unsaturated (vadose) zone. It occurs where a thin layer of soil is underlain by a rock of low porosity.

This makes it even more difficult to predict the proportion of water that enters groundwater compared with the amount which runs off on the Earth’s surface. Moreover, some of the water that infiltrates can be drawn back to the surface by negative pore pressure (also known as capillary action). This occurs essentially because there is a deficit of water in the atmosphere. It can be measured locally with the help of a tensiometer. This these variables that are relevant in a particular area phenomenon explains why salt pans or salt flats occur must be known. in some arid regions, where water evaporates leaving its minerals to accumulate on the surface. 1.3.2 Gaining and losing streams Plants can also return some of the infiltrated water In a topographic situation where a river bed (i.e., the back to the surface.

For these calculations it does not matter exactly where in the aquifer the water is flowing, i.e., whether it is mainly in one highly permeable bed or is more widely distributed. Obtaining hydraulic conductivity and transmissivity values There are three general approaches to finding the value for an aquifer’s hydraulic conductivity, K. The first two options are to perform laboratory testing or to estimate it based on other aquifer properties, such as grain size and porosity (for matrix flow aquifers) 14",

In unconfined aquifers, for example, difference in the local hydraulic head the water table is often used as an important local parameter in groundwater flow calculations, whilst in confined aquifers potentiometric surfaces are used. It is also important to recognise that certain assumptions and simplifications are made in order to calculate the rate of groundwater flow, which may not necessarily align with the real aquifer conditions. These must be well understood and considered when interpreting results. Differences in pressure and elevation, which are created by differences in water level leading to hydraulic gradient, can be sufficient to cause movement of water, including movement uphill. In other words, either elevation or pressure (or a combination of both) can create a potential difference Δh e = ----- which allows water to flow.

Its concentration is a useful indicator of the residence time of groundwater in an aquifer. Another important characteristic of the recharge zone is the presence of oxygen in the aquifer (derived from the atmosphere), which creates an oxidising environment. As groundwater moves away from the recharge zone, two very important changes occur.

Permanent observation well installations can be created by using specialised multi-port tubing and packer arrangements (Misstear et al. 2017). Multi-level well designs have the disadvantages of being more complex and expensive than single-level wells, and the seals may not be effective. The more reliable alternative is to drill a borehole cluster, with screens located in different aquifers; however, this option is even more costly. 4.6.2 Construction of borehole A key borehole characteristic which must be established prior to drilling a monitoring well is its internal diameter (ID). This must be large enough to accommodate any proposed sampling and monitoring equipment. An ID of 50 mm, for example, is suitable for some depth samplers such as the specialised slim sampling devices available on the market, and low-capacity pumps. An ID of 100 mm permits a greater range of sampling equipment and geophysical logging tools. However, IDs greater than 100 mm may make it difficult to purge the borehole adequately (i.e., remove the stagnant water from Figure 4.2 Simple schematic of a multi-level the borehole casing prior to sampling) with a low- monitoring well (adapted from capacity pump. Once the ID is established, the drilled Misstear et al. 2017) diameter for the borehole can be calculated. Its value must be 50-100 mm greater than the maximum outside diameter (OD) of the well casing (see Fig. 4.1). It is very important to choose construction materials that do not react with the contaminants being monitored in samples taken from the well, in order to avoid “false negatives” or “false positives”. Therefore, the casing and screen materials should neither adsorb pollutants from the groundwater, nor leach substances into it. Steel casings, for example, can react with metallic elements in the well water, while certain plastics can react with organic compounds. The material most commonly used in contaminant investigations is polyvinyl chloride (PVC), because it is considered suitable for many applications. However, it should not be used where, for example, organic compounds are present as non-aqueous phase liquids (Fetter et al. 2018",
